Observance of a choice of law clause,"When courts or arbitral tribunals ""respect a choice of law clause,"" it means they acknowledge and apply the specific legal system (the law of a particular country or set of rules) that the parties to a contract have agreed upon to govern their contract. This is a fundamental aspect of upholding party autonomy in contract law, especially in international contexts. Courts or arbitral tribunals will normally respect the parties' contractual choice of law clause, provided that the choice of law is made within the limits set out by the applicable law, usually the lex fori or the lex arbitri. "
Party autonomy,"Party autonomy refers to the power of the parties to a contract to choose a neutral law or the law they consider most appropriate for their specific contract. It enhances certainty and predictability within the parties’ primary contractual arrangement and recognizes that parties to a contract may be in the best position to determine which set of legal principles is most suitable for their transaction. Many States have reached this conclusion and, as a result, giving effect to party autonomy is the predominant view today. However, there are considerable differences regarding the scope of this concept (e.g. with respect to consumer or employment contracts). "
Principles (soft law),"The term soft law is used to denote agreements, principles and declarations that are not legally binding. Soft law instruments are predominantly found in the international sphere.
Principles do not constitute a formally binding instrument, and therefore, States are not obliged to directly apply or incorporate them into their domestic law. Principles can guide the reform of domestic law and operate alongside existing instruments on the subject. 
"
Non-State law (rules of law),"“Non-State law or rules of law” refers to regulations that are generally accepted on an international, supranational, or regional level as a neutral and balanced set of rules. These can include non-binding instruments formulated by established international bodies, such as the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (UPICC). Arbitration statutes and rules often permit contractual disputes to be resolved under such “rules of law.”"
Tacit choice,"Rules of law (also known as 'non-government rules' or 'non-state law'). This term refers to legal norms that are not created by a national government or state. Examples include religious law, tribal law and customary practices recognised and applied by courts or arbitration tribunals."
Partial choice,Partial choice is the prerogative of the parties to indicate that the chosen law does not apply to the entirety of the contract.
Absence of choice,"Absence of choice means that the parties have no agreement on choice of law (e.g., no choice of law clause inserted in their contract), or when a choice of law clause is invalid. In the absence of contractual choice, the adjudicator (judge or arbitrator) must determine the law applicable to the transaction/case."
Arbitration,"Arbitration is a mechanism whereby the settlement of a dispute between two or more parties is entrusted to one or more persons (the arbitrator(s)). The arbitrators derive their powers from a private agreement (the arbitration agreement) and not primarily from the authority of a State. They proceed and decide the case on the basis of the arbitration agreement by rendering a final and binding arbitral award. The parties may specify, either in the arbitration agreement itself (ad hoc arbitration) or indirectly by choosing a set of arbitration rules (institutional arbitration), the method of appointing the arbitrators, the seat (or place) of the arbitration, and also the procedure to be followed while conducting the arbitral process. The guiding principle in arbitration is party autonomy."
Comparative method,"The ""Comparative method"" refers to a legal approach where laws, legal principles, and court decisions from other jurisdictions are considered and analyzed as part of the decision-making process. When using the comparative method, a judge or arbitrator (or any person applying legal rules) may look at how different legal systems have approached similar legal issues or disputes. The purpose of this method is not to directly apply foreign law to a case, but rather to gain insights, perspectives, or guidance that can inform the interpretation and application of domestic law. The ultimate decision must still be based on and be compliant with the domestic legal system and its principles."
Modification of a  choice of law clause,A “modification of a choice of law clause” refers to the process of the parties modifying an existing contractual choice of law clause. A choice of law clause can only be modified with the mutual consent of all parties to the contract. The modification should be made by drafting an amendment to the original contract which specifies the new choice of law. 
Connecting factors,"""Connecting factors"" refer to the elements or considerations used to establish a link or relationship between a legal issue and a particular jurisdiction or legal system in the context of private international law. These criteria help in determining the most appropriate law or jurisdiction to govern a particular legal issue, especially in cases involving international elements. For example, the concept of ""establishment"" is often used as a connecting factor in various jurisdictions to ascertain the internationality of a contract and to determine the law applicable to the parties' agreement on choice of law."
Freedom of Choice,Freedom of choice (also known as the 'principle of freedom of choice'). This term refers to the ability of parties involved in an international transaction to determine themselves the legal system governing their legal relationship. This principle is often referred to as 'party autonomy'.
"Neutral law (""law of a 3rd country"")","A “neutral law” or the “law of a third country” describes a choice of law made by the parties, in which they agree on a law to govern their relationship that is not the law of a country directly connected to either party or their relationship (contract) itself. This approach is often used in cross-border agreements where parties are from different countries. Parties often choose the law of a jurisdiction known for its well-established and stable legal system, predictable legal outcomes, and sophisticated commercial law. This helps in avoiding any perceived home advantage and aims to eliminate any potential bias or conflict of interest that might arise from using the law of a country to which one of the parties is connected. "
Rules of Law,"Rules of law (also known as 'non-government rules' or 'non-state law'). This term refers to legal norms that are not created by a national government or state. Examples include religious law, tribal law and customary practices recognised and applied by courts or arbitration tribunals."
Dépeçage,"Dépeçage is a private international law concept that refers to the process of applying different legal systems or laws to different issues within the same legal relationship. Instead of applying a single jurisdiction’s laws to all aspects of a case, dépeçage allows dissecting the case and applying different laws to different parts of it, based on the most relevant connections those parts have to particular legal systems.  Dépeçage enables the resolution of legal issues by engaging in a choice-of-law analysis on an issue-by-issue basis, but bears the risk of inconsistencies among the various legal systems applied. "
Express choice,"An “express choice” of law is a clear and explicit choice of law stated by the parties, typically in contractual provisions. It reflects the principle of party autonomy, acknowledging that parties are best positioned to select the legal system most suitable for their transaction. This express choice is widely recognized across various international, supranational, and national legal frameworks, albeit within certain limits, such as those imposed by public policy and overriding mandatory rules."
Conventions (hard law),"Hard law refers generally to legal obligations that are binding on the parties involved and which can be legally enforced before a court. If States sign an (international) Convention, they are, in general, obliged to directly apply or incorporate it into their domestic law. "
Incorporate rules by way of reference,"Incorporating rules by way of reference in an international commercial contract means that the parties explicitly agree to be bound by certain rules or laws that are not detailed in the contract itself but are referenced within it. This allows for the inclusion of comprehensive legal frameworks, industry standards, or technical specifications without the need to spell out all the details in the contract, simplifying the document while ensuring that the referenced rules are legally binding. For example, a contract might state that it is governed by “INCOTERMS” (a set of commercial/trade rules established by the International Chamber of Commerce) without reproducing those rules in the contract. These rules become part of the contractual terms agreed between the parties. As per the HCCH Principles, incorporation by reference is different from allowing parties to choose “rules of law” as the law applicable to their contract."
Public policy,"Public policy, in the context of private international law, typically refers to a nation's core legal principles that protect fundamental values and interests, which can override the application of foreign laws or judgments that contravene these principles."
Connection,"""Connection"" is a link or relationship between a legal issue and a particular jurisdiction or legal system in the context of private international law. 
"
Refer to an instrument,"When judges ""refer to an instrument"" in a legal context, it typically means that they are citing or making reference to a specific legal document or authoritative text in their legal reasoning, decision-making process, or written judgment. This could be a statute, a treaty, a judicial decision, a soft law document (e.g., guidelines or principles), or any other authoritative legal text. The judge then analyzes the content of the instrument by interpreting its provisions, understanding its context, and determining how it applies to the specific facts and legal issues of the case. This may involve drawing analogies, noting differences, or using the instrument to clarify or fill gaps in existing law. The judge uses the instrument to support the legal reasoning, and the reference to the instrument may be documented in the judge’s written opinion or judgment. "
Weaker (vulnerable) parties,"Rules of law (also known as 'non-government rules' or 'non-state law'). This term refers to legal norms that are not created by a national government or state. Examples include religious law, tribal law and customary practices recognised and applied by courts or arbitration tribunals."
International (commercial) contracts,"According to the HCCH Principles, a contract is international unless each party has its establishment in the same State and the relationship of the parties and all other relevant elements, regardless of the chosen law, are connected only with that State. These relevant elements may be, for example, the place of conclusion of the contract, the place of performance, a party’s nationality, and a party’s place of incorporation or establishment.A contract is regarded as commercial when each party is acting in the exercise of its trade or profession. E.g., consumer or employment contracts are not commercial contracts."
Mandatory rules,"Overriding mandatory rules can be defined as mandatory rules that are crucial for the countries’ economic, social and political purposes, and their application is required for the disputes within their scope in order to implement the previously mentioned purposes. There are three categories of overriding mandatory rules: overriding mandatory rules pertaining to lex fori; overriding mandatory rules pertaining to lex causae; and finally, overriding mandatory rules of a third country. Overriding mandatory rules take precedent over rules chosen by the parties and therefore supersede them."
