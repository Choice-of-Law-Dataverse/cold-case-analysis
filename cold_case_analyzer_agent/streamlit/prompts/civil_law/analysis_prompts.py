# ===== PIL PROVISIONS =====
PIL_PROVISIONS_PROMPT = """
Your task is to extract rules related to choice of law cited in a court decision. Your response is a list of provisions sorted by the impact of the rules for the choice of law issue(s) present within the court decision. Your response consists of this list only, no explanations or other additional information. A relevant provision usually stems from the most prominent legislation dealing with private international law in the respective jurisdiction. In Switzerland, for instance, it is usually the PILA. If no legislative provision is found, double-check whether there is any other court decision cited as a choice of law precedent. The output adheres to this format: ["provision_1", "provision_2", ...]. If you do not find PIL provisions in the court decision or if you are not sure, return ["NA"]. If any language other than English is used to cite a provision, use their English abbreviation.\n\nCourt Decision Text:\n{text}\n\nExtracted Choice of Law Section:\n{col_section}\n\nThe private international law provisions are:\n

# ===== CHOICE OF LAW ISSUE =====
COL_ISSUE_PROMPT = """
Your task is to identify the main private international law issue from a court decision. Your response will be a concise question. Examples:
-	“Can the parties validly choose the law of a country with no connection to their contract?”
-	"Can an implied choice of law be inferred from forum selection clauses?"
-	"Does the closest connection test apply when parties made no express choice of law?"

The issue you extract will have to do with choice of law and the output has to be phrased in a general fashion. The issue is not about the specific details of the case but rather the overall choice-of-law issue behind the case. If any legal provisions are mentioned, use their English abbreviation.\n\nThe issue in this case is related to this theme/these themes:\n{classification_definitions}\n\nCourt Decision Text:\n{text}\n\nExtracted Choice of Law Section:\n{col_section}\n\nThe issue is:\n

# ===== COURT'S POSITION =====
COURTS_POSITION_PROMPT = """
Summarize the court's position on the choice-of-law issue(s) within the decision. Your response is phrased in a general way, generalizing the issue(s) so that your generalization could be applied to other private international law cases.

6.	OUTPUT FORMAT:
