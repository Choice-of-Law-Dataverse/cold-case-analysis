## What is the Case Analyzer?
An automated analysis of court decisions related to choice of law in international commercial contracts. From each court decision, we analyze the following categories:

| Category | Description | Task |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Abstract | Official abstract of the decision, otherwise AI-generated | Extraction |
| Relevant Facts | A short summary of the facts of the case (who are the parties, what happened, what is the dispute about, the different stages of court proceedings, etc.). This field prioritizes information on choice of law. | Extraction/Summarization |
| Relevant Rules of Law | The relevant legal provisions that are related to choice of law from the choice of law issue(s)/agreement/clause/interpretation(s). This field might also include important precedents or other decisions that were used as a reference in the judgment. | Extraction |
| Choice of Law Issue | Questions arising from the choice of law issue(s)/agreement/clause/interpretation(s) | Classification → Interpretation |
| Court’s Position | The opinion of the court in regard to the statements made in the "Choice of law issue" column. | Extraction/Interpretation |

## How to run the Case Analyzer on your machine
1. Create a file for API secrets under ".env". Use the blueprint.env file for reference
2. Prepare the dataset under "cold_case_analyzer/data/cases.xlsx". Please note that you have to adhere to the given format with the pre-defined column names*
3. (Optional) Create a new virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`
4. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the case analyzer using `python cold_case_analyzer/main.py`

\* Also, it is still necessary to include a separate column with the "Quote"/the Choice of Law section of the original case text. We aim to make this column obsolete eventually, but right now it is still needed.

### Ground Truth

See the ground truth for all 33 cases [here](ground_truth.csv).

## Prompts

**Abstract**
> Your task is to extract the abstract from a court decision. Your response consists of the abstract only, no explanations or other additional information. The official abstract stated in the case is usually right at the beginning, sometimes called "Regeste". If the abstract is not in english, translate it to english. If there is no dedicated abstract to be found, and only then, you have to return a general description of the information in the file. It has to be concise and condense all the key details (topic, provisions, information about the legal dispute) in a single paragraph or less.
If there are any legal provisions mentioned, use their English name/abbreviation.

**Facts**
> Your task is to extract and summarise the relevant facts from a court decision. Your response consists of the relevant facts only, no explanations or other additional information. You return a structured paragraph meaningful for private international law practitioners. The relevant facts summed up from the case must provide a concise account of the factual background that is essential to understanding the legal dispute, avoiding extraneous details. Relevant information includes who are the parties, what happened, what is the dispute about and what are the different stages of court proceedings. Your response prioritizes information on choice of law and can only contain accurate information. Under no circumstance can you add assumptions that are not stated in the case. If there are any legal provisions mentioned, use their English name/abbreviation.


**Issue**
> Your task is to identify the main Private International Law issue from a court decision. Your response will be a concise yes or no question. The issue you extract will have to do with Choice of Law and the output has to be phrased in a general fashion. The issue is not about the specific details of the case, but rather the overall choice of law issue behind the case. If there are any legal provisions mentioned, use their English name/abbreviation.

**Issue Classification**
> Your task is to classify a court decision into one specific theme. Your response is one of the values from the "Keywords" column in the format \"keyword\". You assign the theme by finding the choice of law issue from the court decision and figuring out which Definition fits most. THE OUTPUT HAS TO BE ONE OF THE VALUES FROM THE TABLE.
Here is the table with all keywords and their definitions:

**Position**
> Summarize the court's position on the choice of law issue within a court decision. Your response is phrased in a general way, generalizing the issue so that it could be applied to other private international law cases. If there are any legal provisions mentioned, use their English name/abbreviation.
Your output is a direct answer to the issue laid out here:

**Rules**
> Your task is to extract rules of law from a court decision that is related to choice of law. Your response is a list object of the rules of law sorted by the impact of the rules for the choice of law issue present within the court decision. Your response consists of this list only, no explanations or other additional information. A relevant rule of law usually stems from the most prominent legislation dealing with private international law in the respective jurisdiction. In Switzerland, for instance, it is usually the PILA. If there is no provision from such a prominent legislation found, double-check whether there is any other legal provision or another court decision, cited as a precedent, used in regards to the choice of law context in this court decision. The output adheres to this format: ["provision_1", "provision_2", ...]. If you do not find rules of law in the court decision or you are not sure, return [\"NA\"]. If any language other than English is used to describe a provision, use their English name/abbreviation.
