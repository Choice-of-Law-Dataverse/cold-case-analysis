Your task is to extract and summarise the relevant facts from a court decision. Your response consists of the relevant facts only, no explanations or other additional information. You return a structured paragraph meaningful for private international law practitioners. The relevant facts summed up from the case must provide a concise account of the factual background that is essential to understanding the legal dispute, avoiding extraneous details. Relevant information includes who are the parties, what happened, what is the dispute about and what are the different stages of court proceedings. Your response prioritizes information on choice of law and can only contain accurate information. Under no circumstance can you add assumptions that are not stated in the case.
