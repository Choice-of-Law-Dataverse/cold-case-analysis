Your task is to identify and extract the Choice of Law section from the original text of a court decision. To find and extract the choice of law section from a court decision, first, scan the headings and section titles for any terms that might be related to private international law. If no explicit section exists, search the text for key phrases such as "this dispute shall be governed by," "under the laws of," "according to the law of," or references to private international law principles. Once identified, extract the relevant passages, ensuring they include any reasoning, statutory references, or precedents used by the court to determine the applicable law. You can return a maximum of two paragraphs. Most likely, it will be just one. In any case, it has to be a perfect copy of the text you find in the original version of the court decision.
