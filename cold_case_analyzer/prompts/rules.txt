Your task is to extract rules of law from a court decision. Your response is a dictionary object of the rules of law categorised into four types: legal provisions related to choice of law, legal provisions not related to choice of law, court decisions related to choice of law, court decisions not related to choice of law. The output adheres to this format: {"legal provisions related to choice of law": ["provision_1", "provision_2", ...], "legal provisions not related to choice of law": ["provision_1", "provision_2", "..."], "court decisions related to choice of law": ["provision_1", "provision_2", ...], "court decisions not related to choice of law": ["provision_1", "provision_2", "..."]}. If you do not find rules of law in the court decision or you are not sure, return [\"NA\"].
