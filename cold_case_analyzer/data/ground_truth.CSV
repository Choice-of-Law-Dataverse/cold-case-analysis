Federal Court, 28.07.2009 - BGer 4A_227/2009;Switzerland;"Employment contract; termination, 
appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Labour Court of the Canton of Geneva of March 26, 2009.";The dispute involves the termination of an employment contract between a Swiss company and an employee who worked in Italy. The company verbally informed the employee of her dismissal during a meeting. The employee later claimed that the dismissal was invalid because she was ill and unable to work on the date she received the dismissal notice, which she argued was a violation of Swiss labor law. The company maintained that the dismissal was valid and that the employee had been properly informed.;Art. 121 PILA, Art. 116 PILA;Party autonomy, Tacit choice,Employment contracts, Consumer contracts;Can the parties tacitly choose Swiss law to be applied in cases where the Swiss private international law framework determines a foreign law to be applicable?;According to the court, both parties (lawyers) made a tacit choice of law by referring to Swiss law (vid. Art. 116 PILA). Therefore, in this case, it is possible to deduce from the attitude of the parties the expression of a tacit but conscious choice of law.
Federal Court, 17.12.1991 - BGE 117 II 494 ;Switzerland;"Art. 154 et seq. PILA. Law applicable to the personal statute of a company.
1. review of party capacity in appeal proceedings (E. 2).
2. according to Art. 154 para. 1 PILA, the law of the state in which a company is incorporated is to be used to determine its personal status (E. 4). Under the rule of the PILA, there is no room for the reservation of the fictitious domicile chosen for the purpose of circumventing the law (E. 5 and 6).
On the other hand, the reservation clause of Swiss public policy (Art. 17 PILA) constitutes a general barrier for the incorporation theory (E. 7).
3. capacity to act of the plaintiff, a company domiciled in Panama, affirmed in the present case (E. 8).";A Panamanian company sued to recover an unpaid loan guaranteed by individuals. The Geneva courts dismissed the claim, ruling that the Panamanian company lacked the legal capacity to be a party in Switzerland. The company appealed to the Federal Court, arguing that it should be recognized as a legal entity under Panamanian law.;"Art. 18 PILA,
Art. 154 PILA";Public policy;"Can the courts refrain from applying a foreign substantive law if such law is incompatible with Swiss public policy?
Can a company incorporated under foreign law but not complying with Swiss incorporation requirements be recognized as a legal entity in Switzerland, if its actual operations are not being conducted in that foreign country but in Switzerland?";The court confirmed that under Article 154(1) PILA, the applicable law to determine a company’s status is the law of the place of incorporation. The court rejected the argument that the company’s domicile was fictitious, noting that Article 154(1) PILA does not include a reservation for fictitious domiciles intended to avoid domestic laws. The court also ruled that the Swiss public policy exception (Article 17 PILA) did not apply, as recognizing the company did not violate Swiss public order.
Federal Court, 8.09.2014 - 140 III 473;Switzerland;The court had to determine the law applicable to a contract for the assignment of intellectual property rights (patent). Although the patent protection was sought almost exclusively in the territory of Switzerland, this was not sufficient to override the default rule contained in the law. The default rule contained in the PILA applies, so that the contracts should be governed by the law of the country in which the assignor (a foreign company) has its habitual residence.;"In the present case, representatives of A. AG (based in Switzerland) met in Hong Kong with representatives of B. Ltd. (based in Hong Kong) to negotiate the entitlement to two patent applications: one relating to coffee capsules and the other to a mechanism for piercing the coffee capsules. The parties disagree as to the outcome of the meeting. B. Ltd. argues that they both agreed that it would assign the patent application for the piercing mechanism to A. Ltd. and, in return, would retain the patent applications for the coffee capsules. A. Ltd. denies that any agreement was reached. The appellate court applied Swiss law to resolve the dispute because of the close connection to the contract: Since the patent protection was sought almost exclusively in the territory of Switzerland, the overall connection to Switzerland was considered predominant.
The Swiss Supreme Court decided the case differently. Art. 122 PILA contains a special provision for contracts concerning intellectual property rights: such contracts are governed by the law of the country in which the person transferring the intellectual property right has his habitual residence. A deviation from the usual connection is possible, but only if the facts of the case are clearly more closely connected with another law. The defendant is domiciled in Hong Kong and was also domiciled in Hong Kong at the time of the possible conclusion of the contract. There is also no reason to consider Switzerland as having a clearly much closer connection with Swiss law, justifying the deviation from the general rule of Art. 122 PILA. Hong Kong law should also be applied to resolve the dispute.";Art. 122 PILA;;In the absence of a choice of law agreement, what law applies to a contract for the assignment of intellectual property rights? Should the law governing the contract be applied to determine whether the parties actually concluded the contract? Does the fact that the protection of intellectual property rights concerns almost exclusively the territory of Switzerland justify the application of Swiss law to the case? ;In the absence of a choice of law agreement, contracts for the transfer of intellectual property rights are governed by the law of the country in which the person transferring the intellectual property right has his habitual residence. This law also governs the question of whether the contract was actually entered into by the parties. The fact that the subject matter of the contract, the protection of intellectual property rights, concerns almost exclusively the territory of Switzerland does not justify the application of Swiss law to the case
Federal Court, 26.05.1954 - BGE 80 II 179;Switzerland;"Power of the contracting parties to determine the law governing their relations even during legal proceedings.
In accordance with the provisions of cantonal procedural law, the judge only applies foreign law if the parties expressly invoke it.";;According to old civil procedure laws of certain cantons (now replaced by the Swiss Civil Code [SCC]), the courts only apply foreign law ex officio, if federal legislation or a treaty so prescribes. In all other cases, in order for the judge to rule in accordance with the foreign law, one of the parties must invoke it within the time limit set out. If the parties fail to invoke the applicability of foreign law, Swiss law is applied, either directly or as a supportive law.;Overriding mandatory rules;What are the Swiss overriding mandatory rules if the parties do not choose the law applicable to their contract?;The courts will rule in accordance with the law, which in their view is the law of the country with which the contract has the closest territorial relationship. The court will only apply foreign law if the parties (expressly or implicitly) invoke its application within the set out time limit. If the parties fail to do invoke the applicability of foreign law, the courts will apply Swiss law irrespective of the contracts closest territorial relationship.
Federal Court, 23.03.1965 - BGE 91 II 44;Switzerland;"The place of jurisdiction for the action for attachment shall be determined in accordance with cantonal law, subject to Art. 59 of the Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation and international treaties.
International Code of Obligations; choice of applicable law by the contracting parties. Conditions of validity, time and scope of the choice of law. Which legal systems may the parties choose from? In any case, their choice must be recognized if it is based on a reasonable interest in the application of the chosen law (extension of jurisdiction). Such an interest exists, for example, if the parties agree on the application of the lex fori during the proceedings.";The decision recognizes the validity of choice-of-law agreements even in situations where the chosen law has no geographical connection with the contract. The decision was considered of great importance at the time (1965) since the possibility of agreeing on the applicable law was not regulated in statutory law. The decision leaves open the question of whether parties to international contracts should be granted an unrestricted right of choice, subject to public policy considerations, or whether such an interest should always be required in order to avoid abuses. In this case, the fact that the parties chose the lex fori was sufficient to consider the agreement valid.;Contract law provision applied since the PILA did not exist at the time: Art. 19 CO;Party autonomy, Freedom of choice;Can the parties freely agree on the law applicable to a contract? If so, on what principle would the possibility of determining the applicable law be based? Are there any limits to the parties' freedom of choice? ;The parties may choose the law of a country with which the contract has no geographical connection. This is based on the principle of freedom of contract. In certain cases, however, it may be appropriate to limit the parties' freedom. For a choice of law agreement to be enforceable, it is sufficient that the parties agree on the lex fori as the law applicable to the contract.

Connection of the contract regardless of the hypothetical will of the parties. Purchase or agency agreement? (Rec. 2-4).
In principle, the formation and effects of the contract are to be assessed according to one and the same law, namely according to the law designated by the parties as applicable, or, in the absence of such a designation, according to the law of the country with which the contract is most closely connected. Reservations (Rec. 5).";"Genimportex S.A., a Belgian company, and Emile Chevalley, a merchant domiciled in Switzerland, concluded a ""provisional concession contract"" in Geneva. The contract was concluded in Geneva, Switzerland, but involved performance in Belgium. The parties did not expressly designate the applicable law, nor did their actions conclusively indicate a preference. The court had to decide whether Swiss or Belgian law should apply, focusing on the closest territorial connection and whether the contract was more akin to a sales contract or an agency agreement with exclusive rights. The court set aside the judgment of the lower court, which had incorrectly applied Swiss law. It remitted the case to the cantonal court for a new decision based on Belgian law, ensuring the correct application of the substantive law governing the contract. ";"Contract law provisions applied since the PILA did not exist at the time:

";"Closest connection; place of the characteristic performance. The court ruled that the contract should be governed by Belgian law, as the seller's obligations, which characterize the legal relationship, were to be performed in Belgium.

The lower court rejected the set-off objection. With its appeal, the defendant upholds one of the counterclaims in the amount of CHF 12,000. This is a claim that was originally due to the plaintiff from the company Swiss Rucky in New York and was then allegedly assigned to the defendant. For this claim, the plaintiff had accepted three bills of exchange drawn on him by Swiss Rucky, due on March 25, April 25 and May 25, 1953.
";None;Party autonomy, Tacit choice,Party autonomy, Freedom of choice;What are the requirements for an effective choice of law by the parties? Does the choice of law have to be made expressly? Can the parties choose the applicable law subsequent to the conclusion of the main agreement?;The parties are able to make a subsequent choice-of-law agreement. They are free to choose the form of their choice-of-law agreement. A tacit choice of law is also accepted under the condition that the parties display mutual intent to want the same law to apply to their relationship. 
Federal Court, 17.05.2005 - 4C.458/2004;Switzerland;In the present case, the Supreme Court examines whether the fact that the performance takes place in a third country and that the currency agreed for its payment is the one of the place of performance is sufficient to presume that this country has a close connection with a contract. The court concludes that this is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the law closest to the contract is the law of the country in which the party performing the characteristic performance has its domicile at the time of the conclusion of the contract.;"In the present case, the parties, X SA, based in Switzerland, and Y SRL, based in Italy, agreed that the latter would supply specialised personnel to a waste disposal plant in Germany. After paying part of the agreed remuneration, the Swiss company stopped payment because it considered that the contract had not been properly performed. Both the judge of first instance and the Court of Appeal ordered the debtor to pay the full agreed amount. Both concluded that Italian law was applicable, according to which the defects should have been notified within 60 days of their discovery and not, as in fact happened, more than a year after the completion of the works.
Before the Supreme Court, the appellant argued that German law was applicable because the contract had to be performed in Germany and had been agreed in German currency. Furthermore, according to an agreement between Germany and Italy, if an Italian company carries out activities in Germany for more than six months, it must be considered to have a permanent establishment in Germany.
The Supreme Court rejected the appeal. Under the Swiss conflict-of-laws rule, contracts are governed by the law most closely connected with the contract. The law presumes that this is the law of the country in which the party providing the characteristic performance is domiciled at the time of the conclusion of the contract. Since the employment agency was domiciled in Italy at the time of the conclusion of the contract, the contract should be governed by that law. The fact that the performance takes place in another country and that the currency of the place of performance is agreed is not sufficient to rebut this presumption. Italian law is applicable.";Art. 117 PILA;;How is the law applicable to the contract determined in the absence of a choice of law agreement? What is the law most closely connected with the contract?;In the absence of a choice of law, contracts are governed by the law of the country with which the contract has the closest connection. Such a connection is presumed to exist with the country of the habitual residence of the party who must perform the characteristic obligation. The fact that the performance takes place in another country and that the currency of the place of performance is agreed is not sufficient to rebut this presumption. 
Federal Court, 28.05.2019 - 4A_543/2018  ;Switzerland;In this case, the court had to decide whether an agreement to apply the law of a particular legal system (in this case Swiss law) had the effect of excluding the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The court ultimately rejected the claim and confirmed the application of this international convention. The choice of the law of a contracting state does not imply the exclusion of the CISG, as the CISG is also part of national law.   ;"In the present case, the appellant is suing the respondent for, inter alia, unjust enrichment in connection with a breach of contract in the sale and supply of electricity meters. The court of first instance agreed with the appellant. However, the court of second instance dismissed the claim based on the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the parties had agreed to exclude the application of the CISG, so that only Swiss contract law should be applied to resolve the dispute between the parties.
The Supreme Court ultimately rejected this argument. According to the court, the choice of the law of a contracting state does not constitute an implied exclusion of the CISG, as the CISG is also part of national law. Therefore, an implied exclusion requires further evidence that clearly and unambiguously indicates an opt-out from the CISG. Although the parties expressly agreed to the application of Swiss law and referred in part to the Swiss Code of Obligations, this cannot constitute an implied exclusion of the CISG because the reference does not contradict the point governed by the CISG. Legal arguments based on national law are not automatically sufficient to assume an intention to exclude the application of the CISG. ";"Article 6 CISG,
The parties may exclude the application of this Convention or, subject to article 12, derogate from or vary the effect of any of its provisions.";Party autonomy, Rules of law,Party autonomy, Tacit choice;Should an agreement to apply the law of a particular country that is part of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) have the effect of excluding the application of that Convention? ;No. The choice of the law of a Contracting State does not have the effect of excluding the CISG, since the CISG is also part of national law. 
Federal Court, 07.05.2004 - BGE 130 III 620;Switzerland;"Consideration of third-country overriding mandatory provisions under Art. 19 PILA; requirements for the facts and the exceptional nature of Art. 19 PILA.
Requirements that must be met under Art. 19, para. 1, PILA for a third-country overriding mandatory rule to apply (Sec. 3.3-3.5).
The consideration of such norms must remain the exception, and it is particularly out of the question if the PILA itself provides for a special regulation. The provisions of Art. 166 et seq. PILA for the purpose of recognizing a foreign bankruptcy decree constitutes such a special provision (Sec. 3.5.1).";A U.S. citizen domiciled in California, opened an account with a Swiss bank. The account was registered in the U.S. citizens name, while her and her husband were designated as beneficial owners. Following the husbands bankruptcy in California, his bankruptcy trustee requested the bank to provide details regarding the accounts. However, the bank refused to disclose the information, citing Swiss banking secrecy laws. The wife then filed a claim in a Swiss court to recover the assets in her account, which were allegedly her own, according to a postnuptial agreement signed in the U.S. between her and her husband. The lower court ruled in favor of the bank, invoking Swiss private international law and third-country overriding mandatory provisions from U.S. bankruptcy law, deferring the bank’s payment obligation to the wife.;Art. 19 PILA;Overriding mandatory rules;Can national law of another jurisdiction be taken into account, as an overriding mandatory provision under Art. 19 PILA, despite the parties' agreement that Swiss law governed their contract?;Art. 19 PILA could, in exceptional circumstances, allow the application of overriding mandatory provisions from third countries (such as U.S. bankruptcy law). However, this provision is meant to be applied sparingly and only when there is a close connection between the facts of the case and the third country’s law, and when overriding interests worthy of protection are at stake. Since in the given case there would have been a specific rule of law provided for by Art. 164 et seq. PILA, the Federal Supreme Court did not apply Art. 19 PILA.
Federal Court, 29.06.2010 - BGE 136 III 392;Switzerland;"Requirements under Art. 19 PILA for the consideration of a provision of foreign law despite a choice of law in favor of Swiss law.
";A welder of a Swiss company worked on submarine pipelines on a boat with the Panamian flag. The worker had a dispute with his Swiss employer about a redundancy payment. The worker invoked Panamian law before the Swiss court, even though the employment contract was subject to Swiss law (choice of law). The court dealt with the question of what the requirements under Art. 19 PILA are for the consideration of a provision of foreign law despite a choice of law in favor of Swiss law.;Art. 19 PILA;Overriding mandatory rules;What are the requirements for Swiss courts to apply Art. 19 PILA as a overriding mandatory provision in favor of a foreign law?;The application of Art. 19 PILA is only legitimate under exceptional circumstances. It may be taken into consideration when a mandatory provision of a law other than that designated by the PILA seems more suitable to a situation due to legitimate and preponderant overriding interests with regard to the Swiss conception of law. Also there must be a close connection between the situation in question and the foreign law. If a foreign provision is to be taken into consideration, the aim of the provision and the consequences of its application must be taken into account, in order to arrive at a decision that is adequate in terms of the Swiss conception of law. It is up to the judge to examine whether the connection between the case and the law of the third country are sufficiently important to justify the consideration of the foreign mandatory provision. The judges assessment will be based on the fundamental values of the Swiss legal system, however it is not necessary for Swiss law to have similar peremptory norms. It is sufficient that the aim pursued by the foreign provision is in line with the Swiss concept of law.
Federal Court, 19.01.2001 - BGer 4C.54/2000;Switzerland;Tacit Choice of Law Agreement: The law applicable to a contract may be impliedly agreed by the parties. This can be inferred if the parties were aware that the question of the applicable law had arisen and their actions, whether express or conclusive, are objectively clear enough to be interpreted as an agreement to apply a particular law to the contract.;In this case, the question is whether it can be inferred from certain objective elements that the parties have tacitly agreed on the application of a particular law to the contract. The subject matter of the contract was the importation by a company based in Italy of certain materials and their installation in a property located in Switzerland (the owner was domiciled in Switzerland). The court concluded that in this case the parties had implicitly agreed to the application of Swiss law to the contract. The court based its decision on the following elements: the contract was concluded in Switzerland, it was written in French, the currency of payment was the Swiss franc, the place of performance was Switzerland, a Swiss canton was agreed as the competent court, and the parties referred to Swiss law. The fact that another contract concluded by the same parties was subject to Swiss law was also taken into consideration by the court due to the link between both contracts.   ;Art. 116 PILA;Party autonomy, Tacit choice;Is an express agreement on the applicable law necessary for a choice of law agreement to be valid? Can a choice of law be made tacitly? If so, what elements, for example, could the court take into account to assume the existence of an implied choice of law?;The law applicable to a contract may be impliedly agreed by the parties. An tacit choice of law agreement may be inferred if the parties were aware that the question of the applicable law had arisen and their acts, whether express or conclusive, are objectively clear enough to be interpreted as an agreement to apply a particular law to the contract. By way of example, the following elements may be taken into account by the court in determining the existence of a choice of law agreement: place of conclusion, language of the contract, currency of payment, existence of a choice of court agreement, law applicable to previous contacts between the parties, and references to the laws of a particular country.  If all these elements point to a certain country, a tacit agreement could be assumed.  
Federal Court, 25.04.2002 - BGer 5C.68/2002;Switzerland;According to Art. 116 Federal Act on Private International Law (PILA), the parties are free to choose the law applicable to the contract. This freedom of choice can also be exercised in the context of a guarantee agreement: the law chosen by the creditor of a debt and the guarantor of that debt governs the relationship between them. However, questions relating to the inclusion of the guarantee in insolvency proceedings are governed by the law applicable to those proceedings. This law also governs the question of whether a fraudulent contract entered into by the debtor can be challenged under the Act on Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy.;In the present case, the Court was asked, on the one hand, to determine the law applicable to a guarantee agreement entered into by a company in bankruptcy proceedings for the benefit of a subsidiary. On the other hand, the court also had to determine the law applicable to the question of whether such a guarantee could be included in the bankruptcy proceedings, as well as the order of priority corresponding to the guarantee assumed by the company. The Supreme Court ruled that the law chosen by the creditor and the guarantor in the guarantee contract governs the terms of the internal relationship (in this case, Austrian law). Issues related to the inclusion of the debt in bankruptcy proceedings are governed by the law applicable to bankruptcy proceedings (in this case, Swiss law).;"Art. 116 PILA,

(2) Swiss public policy does not require any special protection for a guarantor resident in Switzerland who concludes a contract of suretyship with international implications and subjects it - possibly only implicitly - to a foreign legal system. This means in particular that such a surety agreement must be recognized by the Swiss judge in enforcement proceedings, even if the formal requirements of Swiss law have not been observed (E. 3).";"Raiffeisenbank Schefflenztal GmbH sued Ulrich Nietzke, for a claim of CHF 10,922.25 plus interest and collection costs. The claim was based on a judgment issued by the Karlsruhe District Court, which ruled on the validity of a guarantee obligation entered into by Ulrich Nietzke. Ulrich Nietzke defended himself against the debt collection proceedings with a timely legal proposal.
Raiffeisenbank Schefflenztal GmbH then filed a request for the opening of legal proceedings with the District Court of Lenzburg, which was rejected. 
Raiffeisenbank Schefflenztal GmbH lodged an appeal against this decision with the High Court of the Canton of Aargau. The court upheld the appeal and granted Raiffeisenbank Schefflenztal GmbH definitive legal opening for the claim amount of CHF 10,387.50 plus 12% interest.

He claims that he was not duly notified of the final foreign judgment, which prevented him from challenging it before the foreign court within the period prescribed by foreign law.

The court considered it appropriate to also examine the validity of the contract under Swiss law and EU competition law, as the contract related to EU member states. A mandatory provision of a law other than the law chosen by the parties may be taken into account if the situation dealt with has a close connection with that other law (Art. 19 PIL).

Federal Court, 23.11.2022- BGE 4A_120/2022;Switzerland;In the context of a contract entered into by parent companies in which their subsidiaries assume certain obligations, the question arises as to the extent to which choice of forum clauses bind the subsidiaries. In order to determine contractual liability, the Supreme Court must determine, among other things, the law applicable to the choice of forum clause and its effect on the beneficiaries of the contract. In this case, the court concludes that any claim by the subsidiaries should be brought only in the forum chosen by the parent companies in the contract. In subsequent contracts, however, the subsidiaries may agree that disputes over new obligations will be litigated in a different forum. ;"The present dispute involves a number of companies and their respective subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries. On the one hand, C AG and its subsidiary A AG (plaintiff). On the other hand, B AG with its subsidiary B Holding and its sub-subsidiary D GmbH (all defendants in the case). 

According to the facts, C AG and B Holding agree in a Master Framework Agreement (""MSA"") that the latter will standardize and automate a number of IT processes. It is also agreed in this contract that B Inc. will provide a parental guarantee (referred to as Parental Guarantee 2) in favor of C AG and its subsidiaries. In connection with the guarantee, it is agreed that German law shall apply and that Germany shall be the place of jurisdiction for any disputes. The agreement (MSA) also provides that the parties may enter into Local Service Agreements (hereinafter referred to as LSAs) with the subsidiaries. On this basis, a Local Service Agreement (LSA) is concluded between A AG and D GmbH, in which a new parental guarantee (Parental Agreement 1) by B Holding in favor of A AG is also agreed. It is agreed that Swiss law will apply and that a Swiss court will be competent to resolve disputes between the parties. Subsequently, A AG sues for breach of both parenting agreements. 

The Federal Supreme Court (FSC) upholds the plaintiffs' claim only with respect to liability under the parenting agreement contained in the LSE. With respect to the liability contained in the MSA, the Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on that claim. According to the Court, the Lugano Convention applies to determine the enforceability of a choice of forum agreement. However, the Lugano Convention does not regulate whether a choice of court agreement applies to third parties (in this case, the subsidiaries). In order to fill this gap and to determine the answer to this question, the Swiss court should also apply national law. Under Swiss law, choice of court agreements are governed by the law applicable to the main contract. Since German law was chosen, it should determine whether and to what extent the choice of court agreement binds third parties.
According to German commentators, the most widely accepted interpretation is that in a contract for the benefit of third parties, the principal parties grant rights to the third parties only in accordance with the terms of the contract. Any claims should also be brought only in the forum chosen by the parties in the contract. Since a German court has been chosen as the competent court, the favored third party must then bring the claim before the German court. ";"Art. 116 PILA

Under Swiss law, the law governing the main contract applies to determine the enforceability and scope of choice of forum clauses. If German law is chosen as the law governing the main contract, that law should also govern the enforceability of the choice of forum clauses contained therein.

In the present case, the law governing the main contract was German law. According to the most widely accepted interpretation in this country, third party claims should be brought in the court chosen in the main contract. Swiss courts therefore have no jurisdiction in this case. "

However, the civil status register was not changed accordingly. At the wedding ceremony, the person appearing as the bride identified herself with a passport in the name of B. X.
In a petition B. X. applied to the Department of Home Affairs of A. Y.'s home canton as the supervisory authority for civil status matters, requesting that the marriage concluded in Copenhagen be recognized and that the civil status office of the home municipality be instructed to make the corresponding entry in the register.
The Department ordered that the marriage not be recognized and that the requested entry in the register be refused.
B. X. lodged an administrative appeal with the Federal Supreme Court, requesting that the order of the Department be set aside and that the application submitted be granted.
The cantonal Department of Home Affairs requested that the appeal be dismissed. The Federal Department of Justice and Police (Federal Office of Justice) stated that it essentially agrees with the legal opinion of the cantonal authority.

The court concluded that the law applicable to the contract should be applied to determine the scope of the jurisdiction clauses. Since, under the applicable law, jurisdiction clauses do not cover the right of creditors to obtain information from the registry, the Swiss conflict of laws rules (i.e. PIL-rules) should be applied to resolve the dispute. ;"The parties, an insurance company (domiciled in Peru) and a reinsurance company (domiciled in Switzerland), had agreed to apply Peruvian law and the exclusive jurisdiction of Peruvian judges to a contract entered into between them. Due to a disagreement between the parties, legal proceedings were initiated in the agreed forum. However, in the midst of this process, the Peruvian company decided to file a lawsuit in the Swiss courts to obtain access to the most recent annual report and audit report in order to determine the company's financial position in the event of future debt enforcement. The Swiss judge granted the request. In a civil appeal, the Swiss company asked the Swiss Federal Supreme Court to overrule the commercial court's decision on the grounds of the court's lack of jurisdiction and to dismiss the Peruvian company's request.
The Swiss Supreme Court rejected the appeal. According to the court, the law applicable to the contract governs the interpretation of the jurisdiction clause, including its scope. The question of whether the right of access to financial information is included in the jurisdiction clause must then be determined under Peruvian law. Under Peruvian law, the jurisdiction clause does not apply to the request for access to the most recent annual report and audit report. Swiss conflict-of-law rules should also apply to determine the jurisdiction of the Swiss courts and the applicable law, as neither the choice of law nor the jurisdiction clause covers this issue. Finally, it concluded that the Swiss courts had jurisdiction and that Swiss law should be applied to resolve the dispute. ";Art. 5 PILA;;Which law governs the interpretation of jurisdiction clauses?

Appeal against the decision of the Civil Division of the Geneva Court of Justice of April 18, 2008.;"The Court is called upon to determine the law applicable to a dispute concerning compensation of obligations. The case involved a person who had given a guarantee for a loan granted to a company. The amount of the guarantee exceeded the amount of the credit. However, when the guarantee was executed in favor of the creditor, he decided to send the excess amount to the insolvency administrator, as the company was in insolvency proceedings at the time.  The liquidator refused to release the money to the guarantor because he – the guarantor – owed the company money. As the guarantor was domiciled in Spain, the first issue to be resolved was the law applicable to the case. 
According to the court, it was not necessary to discuss in detail the question of the law applicable to the dispute. Since the question of the applicable law was never raised between the parties, they assumed that the applicable law was Swiss law, which could be assumed to be the law chosen by the parties. In the decision, the court also mentions that according to Art. 148 PILA, in the case of a set-off, the extinguishment is governed by the law of the claim the repayment of which is the purpose of the set-off.

The law applicable to the contract of inheritance is the law of the domicile of the testator or of the testator at the time of the conclusion of the contract and not at the time of death (E. 3). In the case under review, it cannot be assumed that the Brazilian prohibition on inheritance contracts is mandatory and thus renders the inheritance contract validly concluded under Swiss law null and void (E. 4).
";X. and Y. married in 1958 in São Paulo, Brazil. Their marriage remained childless. On November 11, 1992, the spouses X. and Y. had an inheritance contract notarized at their domicile in Appenzell, in which they appointed each other as sole heirs to their entire estate. In the event that each spouse survived the other, each appointed the siblings and their descendants as heirs in equal shares, i.e. one quarter to the children of brother A. of Y. and one quarter each to the children of the two sisters B. and C. and brother D. of X. (item II/2). (No. II/2). The spouses declared that Swiss law should apply to the estate of both spouses (para. III of the inheritance agreement). On June 10, 2003, X. died in France. He was a Brazilian and German national. Y. drew up testamentary dispositions on January 5, 2005 in Paris, on February 2, 2005 in Paris and on April 20, 2005 in São Paulo and appointed the two children of her brother A. as her universal legal successors. She gave them real estate in Paris on February 1, 2005 and real estate in São Paulo on October 28, 2005. On November 19, 2005, Y. (testatrix) died in São Paulo. She was a Brazilian national. In a complaint dated February 8, 2007, the children of the siblings B., C. and D. of X. (respondent) requested that the testamentary dispositions and the gifts of the testatrix be declared invalid, possibly reduced, insofar as the inheritance contract between the testatrix and her predeceased husband was thereby violated. The children of the testatrix's brother A. (appellants) decided to dismiss the action. The District Court Appenzell dismissed the action. On appeal by the respondents, the Cantonal Court of Appenzell Innerrhoden set aside the testamentary dispositions of the testatrix dated January 5, 2005, February 2, 2005 and April 20, 2005, insofar as the respondents' status as heirs to a total of ¾ of the testatrix's estate located in Switzerland was thereby infringed.

Subsequently, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant before the Local Court of Lucerne and demanded a partial amount of CHF 50,000 of the CHF 300,000 under the legal title of (partial) repayment of the loan. The Local Court and, on appeal by the defendant, the High Court of the Canton of Lucerne upheld the claim.
Later the plaintiff filed a new action against the defendant with the Local Court of Lucerne-City and demanded payment of the remaining amount of the loan claim of CHF 250,000. The defendant applied for the claim to be dismissed insofar as it should be upheld. He argued that it was not true that the plaintiff had granted him a loan. Rather, she had handed over CHF 300,000 to X. AG so that he could take a fiduciary interest in X. AG on her behalf.
The district court upheld the claim and the defendant appealed against this to the High Court of the Canton of Lucerne. The court dismissed the appeal and again the defendant filed a federal appeal to the Federal Supreme Court.

What are the criteria employed to assess a tacit choice of law?;A choice of law must be explicit or must be clearly revealed from the contract or from the circumstances surrounding it. The acceptance of a choice of law contract presupposes that the parties were aware of the conflict of laws and wished to express a corresponding choice of law (intention to do so). If the choice of law results from a normative commitment, an additional objectively sufficiently conclusive, express or implicit declaration of intent is also required, which the recipient understood unambiguously in accordance with the principle of good faith. This can also be seen in the fact that a party expressly refers to provisions or institutes of a specific law.

This reservation only applies if the result of the assessment is determined in accordance with the foreign law referred to and this result is intolerably offensive to the domestic sense of justice or contradicts the meaning and spirit of the domestic legal system in an objectionable manner. However, the determination and hypothetical application of the applicable foreign law must be dispensed with from the outset if Swiss legal provisions are directly applicable pursuant to Art. 18 PILA, i.e. irrespective of the law designated by the statute. These so-called lois d'application immédiate comprise the positive ordre public. The mandatory provision of Swiss law therefore has its own territorial scope of application, which is able to assert itself against the more general conflict of laws rule and eliminates it. For such a provision, there is a special link to collision law. Positive public policy includes, in particular, norms that take into account the essential interests of the social, political or economic order. Particular caution is required in the exceptional application of both negative and positive public policy in cases where the matter to be judged has practically no connection with Switzerland.

A choice of law in favor of a particular law and a waiver of the application of another law can logically only be said to exist where the parties have become aware that the question of the applicable law arises. This is because the choice can only be made by those who know that they have the option of subjecting a contractual relationship to one or the other legal system, and likewise only those who are aware of the two available options can waive one of them. A contract of reference based on concordant declarations, as is necessary for a choice of law, thus presupposes that the parties have a conscious intention to choose the law and wish to express this intention. If, on the other hand, the parties did not consider the question of the applicable law at all, the fact that they assumed the domestic legal system could not in itself constitute a choice of law. 
Although a hypothetical will of the parties as a hidden link is generally irrelevant, a normative consensus is also sufficient for the conclusion of a referral contract. However, the clarity of the choice of law required by the legislator requires an objectively sufficiently conclusive express or implied declaration of intent, which may and must be unambiguously understood by the recipient as an offer of a referral contract in accordance with the principle of trust. The mere fact of referring, in the proceedings, to a specific law is not sufficient to admit a choice of law agreement in accordance with the principle of trust."

In the present case, the court considers that the choice of law was tacitly agreed by the participants in the transaction. ;"Two parties, B AG and C GmbH, enter into a cooperation agreement. In this agreement it was agreed, inter alia, that ""A"" would be liable for damages arising from the failure of C GmbH to fulfil its obligations. The cooperation agreement between B AG and C GmbH refers to Liechtenstein law as the law applicable to the contract. Some years later, B AG brought an action against A and demanded repayment of commission advances. The District Court upheld the claim in its entirety. The defendant appealed this decision to the court of second instance, which upheld the judgment of the district court. This decision was appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds, inter alia, that the choice of law clauses related only to the relationship between B AG and C GmbH and therefore did not apply to A's obligations. In his view, Lichtenstein law was not applicable to his contractual relationship with B AG.  
The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeal. It recognised that there was no express agreement between B and A on the law applicable to liability. However, in application of the principle of trust, the choice of law in favour of Liechtenstein law also applies to the legal relationship with regard to the security clause. On the basis of the wording and structure, it can be assumed that the parties' declaration of intent was sufficiently conclusive and at least implicitly consistent. The fact that the complainant's signature in her own name referred only to the liability clause did not mean that the choice of law clause did not also apply to the assumption of debt. Comments against the application of this right should have been made at the appropriate time and not in the context of a procedural dispute concerning the performance of contractual obligations.  ";Art. 116 PILA ;;"Should a choice of law agreement included in a contract extend its effect to a clause by which another person assumes liability for non-compliance with the contract?
What is the effect of a choice-of-law agreement on a person who is a guarantor of the performance of the contract?";In application of the principle of trust, the choice of law agreement can be extended to the obligations assumed by the guarantors who participate in the contract. Depending on the circumstances, the guarantor may be deemed to have tacitly accepted the application of the law governing the main contract. 
Federal Court, 21.11.2006 - BGE 133 III 90;Switzerland;"Change in the circumstances of attachment in continuing obligations; applicable law; change of status (Art. 117 PILA).
Conditions under which a change in the circumstances of attachment in continuing obligations gives rise to a change of status (Sec. 2).
If a contractual relationship is organized functionally in such a way that the person providing the characteristic service performs the obligation he has entered into independently of the place where he is staying, his change of domicile during the contract does not result in a change of status (Sec. 3).";"In the present case, the question arises whether a subsequent change in the connecting factors can affect the determination of the applicable law. According to the PILA, in the absence of a choice of law agreement, contracts are governed by the law that has the closest connection with the contract. Swiss law further presumes that such a connection exists with the country of habitual residence of the party who must perform the characteristic obligation of the contract. The main issue in the case is whether a change in the domicile - afther the conclusion of the contract - to another country results in a change in the law applicable to the contract.
Ultimately, the Swiss Supreme Court held that a subsequent change of domicile does not result in a change of applicable law. Although the court acknowledged that this may be justified in certain circumstances, it also stated that legal certainty and predictability should be taken into account when deciding on the law applicable to the contract. It also takes into account the fact that the law of the new domicile has no connection with the contact, since it does not coincide with the place of permanence, the place of conclusion or the domicile of the other party.  The court therefore concludes that the law of the new domicile cannot be considered as the law closest to the relationship. The law of the place of residence of the party at the time of the conclusion of the contract remains therefore the law governing the legal relationship between the parties. ";Art. 117 PILA;Absence of choice;In the absence of a choice of law agreement, should a subsequent change in the domicile of the party who must perform the characteristic obligation of the contract affect the determination of the applicable law? ;Although this cannot be excluded in general, it is not justified in the present case because the resulting law has no connection with the contract. In any event, legal certainty and predictability must be taken into account when determining the law applicable to the contract.

Supplement to a French divorce decree regarding the division of the termination benefit accumulated with a Swiss pension fund.";The case discussed the amendment of a foreign divorce decree. A couple got married in Basel (Switzerland) and then moved to France during the course of their marriage. The couple then got a divorce in France, where the court did not deal with the distribution of the husband's pension fund. After the divorce, the woman moved back to Basel and filed for a reevaluation of the divorce settlement by the civil court. The civil court denied the case and the woman appealed to the court of appeals of the canton Basel-Stadt. The court of appeals then evaluated the settlement and found that the distribution of the husband's pension fund (since it was acquired in Switzerland) is subject to Swiss law. The court, therefore, ordered the pension fund to be divided between the ex-partners. The husband filed an appeal with the Swiss Supreme Court, which evaluated the case and dismissed historical appeal.;"Art. 15 PILA,

Does filing an action before a court in a foreign country constitute a choice of law? Does a choice of court constitute a tacit choice of law?;A choice-of-law agreement does not need to be explicit but clearly made. Filing an action before a foreign court or a choice-of-court agreement does not amount to a choice of law.
