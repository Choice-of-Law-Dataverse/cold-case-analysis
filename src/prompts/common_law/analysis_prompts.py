# ===== CHOICE OF LAW ISSUE =====
COL_ISSUE_PROMPT = """
TASK: Identify the specific choice of law questions that the court actually decided in this private international law (PIL) case.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Issue Identification Criteria:
Extract only questions about applicable law that the court explicitly or implicitly resolved to reach its decision. Focus on what the court needed to determine, not what parties argued or preliminary questions considered but not decided. If there is only one issue, then return only one question.
2.	Question Formulation:
Frame each issue as a precise legal question. Examples:
-	“Can the parties validly choose the law of a country with no connection to their contract?”
-	"Can an implied choice of law be inferred from forum selection clauses?"
-	"Does the closest connection test apply when parties made no express choice of law?"
3.	Scope Guidelines:
-	Include: Questions about validity of express choices, methods for determining implied choices, default rules in absence of choice, scope of chosen law, renvoi issues
-	Include: Issues about connecting factors, party autonomy limitations, public policy exceptions
-	Exclude: Pure jurisdictional questions, procedural law issues, enforcement matters unrelated to choice of law
4.	Output Requirements:
-	Return a concise question. Only if the choice of law issues present in the case thematically exceed the possibility of phrasing it in one single questions, return more.
-	Use precise, legally accurate terminology
-	Ensure each question reflects a choice of law determination actually made by the court
5.	Quality Check: Each identified issue should be answerable by pointing to specific court reasoning in the choice of law analysis.

# ===== COURT'S POSITION =====
COURTS_POSITION_PROMPT = """
TASK: Extract the binding legal principle(s) that the court established as essential to its choice of law decision.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Ratio Identification Method:
-	Identify each legal proposition the court stated regarding choice of law

2.	Content Requirements:
-	Extract the court's binding legal rule(s), not factual findings or case-specific applications
-	State each principle as a clear, precedential rule applicable to future cases
-	Focus on private international law (PIL) methodology, not the specific contractual or factual outcome
-	Use the court's own formulation where possible, condensed into the form of a principle.
3.	Output Specifications:
-	State each ratio as a complete legal principle in 1-2 sentences maximum
-	If multiple ratios exist on different choice of law points, number them separately
-	Ensure each principle directly addresses the legal issue(s) previously identified
-	Avoid factual details, policy reasoning, or persuasive commentary
4.	Quality Standards:
-	Each ratio should be actionable as precedent in future PIL cases
-	Principles should be neither too narrow (case-specific) nor too broad (unhelpful generalization)
-	Focus on what the court held must be done, not what it suggested or considered

COURTS_POSITION_OBITER_DICTA_PROMPT = """
TASK: Extract judicial observations about choice of law that are not essential to the court's decision but provide persuasive legal commentary.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Obiter Identification Method:
-	Apply the inversion test: Could the court have reached the same decision if this statement were omitted or reversed?
-	If yes, the statement is obiter dicta

2.	PIL-Relevant Obiter Categories:
-	Alternative choice of law approaches the court considered but didn't apply
-	Comparative observations about foreign private international law (PIL) systems or practices
-	Commentary on the development or future direction of PIL
