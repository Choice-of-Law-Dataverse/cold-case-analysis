Name,Alpha-3 Code,Jurisdiction Summary
Aruba,ABW,
Angola,AGO,"Angola and Mozambique share a private international law (PIL) framework rooted in the Portuguese Civil Code of 1966, reflecting their colonial history under Portugal. Both countries recognize party autonomy as the primary connecting factor for international commercial contracts, as stipulated in Article 41(1) of the Civil Code. However, this autonomy is not absolute; the chosen law must have a relevant connection to the contract or reflect a serious interest of the parties (Article 41(2) CC). The legal systems of Angola and Mozambique continue to rely heavily on Portuguese judgments and doctrine due to the limited development of their own jurisprudence. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts (2015) are not explicitly recognized but could aid in interpreting the outdated conflict-of-law rules. Both countries' arbitration acts support party autonomy, though the acceptance of non-state laws like lex mercatoria remains uncertain. According to the legislation currently in force in these countries, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the common habitual residence of the parties or, failing that, the place of contract conclusion."
Anguilla,AIA,
Albania,ALB,"The Western Balkans, comprising Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Serbia, have diverse private international law (PIL) frameworks, largely influenced by their shared Yugoslavian legal heritage, except for Albania. The Yugoslavian Law on Resolving Conflict of Laws (1982) continues to apply in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Serbia, while North Macedonia and Montenegro have enacted more modern PIL laws in 2007 and 2013, respectively. Albania, distinct in its legal evolution, adopted a new PIL Act in 2011. These countries generally recognize party autonomy in international contracts, aligning with the Rome Convention and EU regulations, although the Hague Principles on Choice of Law are not explicitly integrated. Kosovo, due to its disputed statehood, faces unique challenges in international treaty participation. The region's legal systems are gradually modernizing, with ongoing reforms in Serbia, North Macedonia, and Kosovo aiming for EU harmonization. According to the legislation currently in force in these countries, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place where the party performing the characteristic obligation is domiciled or has its seat."
Andorra,AND,
Netherlands Antilles,ANT,
United Arab Emirates,ARE,"The United Arab Emirates (UAE) operates under a federal system established in 1971, with private international law (PIL) codified in the UAE Civil Code (Federal Law No 5 of 1985), specifically Articles 10 to 28. These articles address conflict of law rules for international commercial contracts. Party autonomy is recognized, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, as per Article 19(1) of the Civil Code. However, the UAE courts often apply local law unless foreign law is proven by the party relying on it. The UAE is not a member of the Hague Conference and has not signed the CISG, but international treaties like the New York Convention override municipal law when applicable. The UAE courts may refer to general principles of PIL in the absence of statutory provisions, and Egyptian legal writings hold persuasive authority due to the Civil Code's Egyptian roots. In the absence of a choice, the contract is governed by the law of the parties' joint domicile or, if none, the law of the state where the contract was concluded, according to the legislation currently in force in this country."
Argentina,ARG,"Argentina's private international law (PIL) framework for international commercial contracts is primarily governed by the Argentine Civil and Commercial Code (CCyCN), which came into force on August 1, 2015. The CCyCN recognizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts, as outlined in Article 2651. This choice can be express or tacit, and the law chosen must be a state law, although non-state laws can be incorporated by reference. Argentina is a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods of 1980, but not the 1994 Inter-American Convention on the Law Applicable to International Contracts. The CCyCN also addresses issues such as renvoi, public policy, and internationally mandatory rules. In the absence of a choice by the parties, Article 2652 of the CCyCN dictates that the contract is governed by the laws and usages of the place of compliance."
Armenia,ARM,"The private international law (PIL) framework in the South Caucasus, encompassing Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, is primarily statutory, with each country having its own legislation influenced by the 1994 CIS Model Civil Code. These statutes are complemented by CIS treaties like the Kishinev and Minsk Conventions, which provide choice-of-law provisions. Armenia also adheres to the Kiev Convention. Case law, particularly in Armenia, plays a significant role in interpreting these statutes, with Armenian courts recognizing the stare decisis principle. Party autonomy is a central tenet, allowing parties to choose applicable laws, although non-state laws are generally excluded unless incorporated by reference. In the absence of a choice, Armenian and Azerbaijani laws default to the law of the party providing the characteristic performance, while Georgian law applies the law of the country most closely related to the contract. According to the legislation currently in force in these countries, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the party providing the characteristic performance or the country most closely related to the contract."
American Samoa,ASM,

Australia,AUS,"Australia's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is primarily governed by common law rules, which identify the ""proper law of the contract"" as the law chosen by the parties or, in the absence of such a choice, the law with the closest and most real connection to the contract. This framework applies to both international commercial and consumer or employment contracts. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) provides substantive law for international sale contracts, though parties can exclude it. There have been proposals to reform Australia's common law rules by adopting the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts, but these have not yet been implemented. Courts may consider the Hague Principles when developing common law rules, especially if the parties have chosen to incorporate them. The current framework is criticized for its ambiguity and lack of comprehensive rules, particularly regarding the scope of the chosen law and issues like assignment and severability. According to the legislation currently in force in Australia, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law with which it has the closest and most real connection."
Austria,AUT,"The Rome I Regulation is the primary legal framework for determining the applicable law in international commercial contracts within the European Union, excluding Denmark. It supersedes the 1980 Rome Convention and applies to contracts concluded after December 17, 2009. The Regulation emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts. However, it excludes certain issues like arbitration agreements, insolvency proceedings, and the capacity of natural persons. The Regulation aligns with the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts, and the European Court of Justice (CJEU) ensures its uniform interpretation across the EU. In the absence of a choice of law by the parties, the Rome I Regulation dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the country where the party required to effect the characteristic performance of the contract has their habitual residence."
Azerbaijan,AZE,"The private international law (PIL) framework in the South Caucasus, encompassing Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, is primarily statutory, with each country having its own legislation influenced by the 1994 CIS Model Civil Code.

Bahrain,BHR,"Bahrain's private international law (PIL) framework is relatively recent, with its first codification occurring just before its independence in 1971. The legal system is influenced by Islamic teachings, particularly the Maliki School, and the civil law tradition, notably French and Egyptian laws. The primary legislative text governing PIL is the Act No. 6/2015 on Conflict of Law in Civil and Commercial Matters involving a Foreign Element, which emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts. This principle is reinforced by the Bahrain Chamber for Economic, Financial and Investment Dispute Resolution (BCDR) and the Bahraini Arbitration Act, which incorporates the UNCITRAL Model Law. In the absence of a choice of law by the parties, the 2015 Act provides a cascade of connecting factors, prioritizing the law of the common domicile or the place of contract conclusion. According to the legislation currently in force in Bahrain, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the state where the parties have their common domicile, or where the contract was concluded."

Belarus,BLR,
Belize,BLZ,
Bermuda,BMU,
Bolivia,BOL,"Bolivia's private international law framework for international commercial contracts is characterized by limited legal provisions and precedents, yet it emphasizes party autonomy, custom, usage, equity, and culture. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts (2015) are seen as a valuable tool for supplementing or interpreting national laws, provided they do not conflict with Bolivia's mandatory rules or public policy. The Bolivian Constitution supports party autonomy, stating that individuals are not compelled to act beyond what the law mandates. Legal pluralism allows indigenous communities to apply their own legal systems, potentially affecting party autonomy. Bolivia is a signatory to several international instruments, including the Montevideo Treaties and the Bustamante Code, though their application is limited. The Civil and Commercial Codes, along with the Code of Civil Procedure, form the domestic legal basis, with the Arbitration Law supporting party autonomy in arbitration. According to the legislation currently in force in Bolivia, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place of performance, typically Bolivian law."
Brazil,BRA,"Brazil's private international law (PIL) framework has historically been restrictive regarding party autonomy in international contracts. Initially, Article 13 of the 1916 Introduction to the Brazilian Civil Code allowed limited freedom to choose applicable law, but the 1942 Law of Introduction to the Brazilian Civil Code imposed a rigid connecting factor, favoring the law of the place where the contract was concluded (lex loci celebrationis). The 1990s saw a gradual acceptance of party autonomy, with the 1996 Brazilian Arbitration Act recognizing parties' freedom to choose governing law in arbitration. The Superior Court of Justice (STJ) has also acknowledged party autonomy in judicial contexts, despite the restrictive language of Article 9 of the Law of Introduction to the Norms of Brazilian Law (LINDB). Legislative proposals aim to modernize PIL by incorporating the Hague Principles, promoting party autonomy without requiring a connection between the chosen law and the parties or transaction. According to the legislation currently in force in Brazil, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place where the contract has been concluded."

Canada,CAN,"Canada's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is shaped by its federal structure, with jurisdiction over private international law (PIL) matters primarily residing at the provincial level. Quebec (https://alpha.cold.global/jurisdiction/que) stands out for its comprehensive codification in the Civil Code of Quebec (CCQ), which is inspired by the 1988 Swiss PIL legislation and the 1980 Rome Convention. This codification emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law without requiring a connection to the contract. In contrast, the common law provinces rely on case law, notably the 1939 Privy Council decision in Vita Food Products, which upholds party autonomy but allows for exceptions based on public policy. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts (2015) are not formally adopted but align with Canadian principles, offering interpretative guidance. Quebec's codification includes specific rules for various contract types, while common law provinces apply a general ""closest connection"" test. According to the legislation currently in force in Canada, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law most closely connected to the contract."
Cocos (Keeling) Islands,CCK,
Switzerland,CHE,"Switzerland's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is primarily governed by the Swiss Federal Act on Private International Law (PILA), which came into force on January 1, 1989. This comprehensive codification addresses jurisdiction, international civil procedure, applicable law, and the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. The PILA emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts, although certain issues like legal capacity and choice of court agreements are governed by specific rules. The Swiss Federal Court, while not bound by stare decisis, influences lower courts through its interpretations, often referencing international principles like the Hague Principles for guidance. The PILA does not explicitly allow for the choice of non-state rules, but Swiss academic opinion is divided on this issue. In the absence of a choice, the PILA dictates that contracts are governed by the law of the state with the closest connection, typically the habitual residence or place of business of the party performing the characteristic obligation."
Chile,CHL,"Chile's private international law (PIL) framework is characterized by a lack of comprehensive statutory provisions, leading to significant gaps and reliance on judicial interpretation. The legal system is dualist, with international commercial arbitration governed by Act No. 19.971, based on the UNCITRAL Model Law, which supports party autonomy. However, a territorialist approach persists in common courts, rooted in the 19th-century Civil and Commercial Codes. The Civil Code's Article 16 and the Commercial Code's Article 113 are pivotal, often interpreted to mean that contracts to be fulfilled in Chile are governed by Chilean law unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Chile ratified the Bustamante Code in 1933, but with reservations that limit its application, leading to criticism for not aligning with global economic needs. Efforts to modernize the system include a draft Act of Private International Law, incorporating elements from the Hague Principles. According to the legislation currently in force in Chile, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place where it is to be fulfilled, typically Chilean law."
China (Mainland),CHN,"China's private international law framework for international commercial contracts emphasizes party autonomy and the closest connection doctrine. The Foreign Economic Contract Law of 1985 first established these principles, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts. If no choice is made, the law of the country most closely connected to the contract applies. This approach is reflected in subsequent legislation, including the General Principles of the Civil Law, the Civil Aviation Law, and the Maritime Law. The Contract Law of 1999 retained these rules, and the 2010 Law on Application of Law for Foreign-Related Civil Relationships further codified them, specifying rules for general and special contracts like consumer and labor contracts. The Supreme People's Court has issued several interpretations to guide the application of these laws. According to the legislation currently in force in China, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected."
Ivory Coast,CIV,
Common-law Africa,CLA,
Cameroon,CMR,
"Congo, the Democratic Republic of the",COD,"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is primarily influenced by international treaties, notably the OHADA Treaty, which harmonizes business law across member states. The OHADA Uniform Acts, including those on General Commercial Law and Arbitration, take precedence over national laws, as stipulated by Article 10 of the OHADA Treaty. Historically, the Decree of 4 May 1895 and the Family Code of 1987 provided conflict-of-law rules, but these were repealed in 2016, leaving a gap in the statutory framework. In the absence of specific legislation, Congolese courts rely on general principles of law and equity, as outlined in the Ordinance of 14 May 1886 and Law no 13/011-B of 2013. Party autonomy is recognized, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, although there is no requirement for a connection between the chosen law and the contract. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts could potentially guide future legislative developments. According to the legislation currently in force in this country, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place of its conclusion."
Congo,COG,
Cook Islands,COK,
Colombia,COL,"In Colombia, the legal framework for international commercial contracts is governed by both the Civil Code and the Commercial Code, which are complementary in regulating such contracts. The principle of territoriality is a key aspect, as Colombian law applies to all individuals within its territory, but exceptions exist, such as the personal statute for Colombians abroad. The Commercial Code specifies that contracts executed abroad but performed in Colombia are subject to Colombian law. Although there is no comprehensive modern private international law, the Bogota Chamber of Commerce is drafting legislation to address this. The Hague Principles and UNIDROIT Principles are recognized for their interpretative value, aiding in modernizing the legal approach. Party autonomy is acknowledged, allowing parties to choose applicable law, but with limitations, especially concerning public policy and mandatory rules. In the absence of a choice, the legislation in force in Colombia dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the place of performance, following the lex loci solutionis principle."
Comoros,COM,
Cape Verde,CPV,
Costa Rica,CRI,"Costa Rica's private international law (PIL) framework is not systematically codified but relies on international treaties, domestic laws, and the Law on International Commercial Arbitration. The Bustamante Code, although ratified, has limited practical impact due to reservations that prioritize national legislation. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), ratified in 2016, modernizes the legal framework for international sales. The Costa Rican Civil Code and Code of Civil Procedures provide some PIL rules, focusing on contracts involving Costa Rican citizens and foreigners, and assets located in Costa Rica. Party autonomy is recognized, allowing parties to choose applicable law unless it contravenes public policy or third-party interests. The Law on International Commercial Arbitration, inspired by the UNCITRAL Model Law, supports party autonomy and allows for the application of international principles like the UNIDROIT Principles. However, Costa Rican courts typically apply domestic law, limiting the use of soft law instruments. According to the legislation currently in force in Costa Rica, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place where it was signed, or the law of the parties' common nationality."

Dubai,DUB,"The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) operates as an independent jurisdiction within the Emirate of Dubai, with its own legal framework for civil and commercial matters, distinct from the UAE's civil law system. The DIFC's private international law (PIL) framework is primarily based on English common law principles, emphasizing party autonomy in choosing the applicable law for contracts. The DIFC Law Application Law codifies the choice-of-law rules, allowing parties to select the governing law, provided it does not conflict with public policy or morals. In the absence of an express choice, DIFC law applies by default. The DIFC Courts can consider decisions from other jurisdictions and may refer to the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts. The DIFC's legal system excludes renvoi and does not explicitly allow non-state rules of law unless incorporated into the contract. The DIFC Arbitration Law, influenced by the UNCITRAL Model Law, permits parties to choose the governing law or rules of law for arbitration, with no default to DIFC law if no choice is made. According to the legislation currently in force in this jurisdiction, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the DIFC."
Algeria,DZA,
Ecuador,ECU,
Egypt,EGY,"Egypt's private international law (PIL) framework for international commercial contracts is primarily governed by the Egyptian Civil Code No. 131/1948 and the Egyptian Arbitration Code No. 27/1994. Party autonomy is generally accepted, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts. However, certain contracts, such as those involving technology transfer and commercial agency, are excluded from this rule. The Egyptian Civil Code's Article 19 and the Arbitration Code's Article 39 differ in their application of party autonomy, with Article 39 being more liberal. Egypt's PIL is not fully developed, and there is limited scholarship and case law in this area. The Egyptian courts have the flexibility to develop PIL rules due to the flexible language of the Civil Code. Egypt is a member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and can refer to the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts to supplement its domestic rules. According to the legislation currently in force in Egypt, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the parties' common domicile or, in its absence, the law of the place where the contract was concluded."

Ethiopia,ETH,"Ethiopia lacks a codified private international law (PIL) framework, with no comprehensive case law to derive key principles. The Civil Code, drafted by Rene David, initially included conflict of laws provisions, but these were omitted, leaving Ethiopia without formal conflict of law rules. Efforts to draft a PIL code, such as Sedler's Draft and the FDRE Draft, have not been enacted but are sometimes referenced by courts. Party autonomy in choice of law is inconsistently recognized, with some court decisions approving foreign law application and others rejecting it. The FDRE Draft acknowledges party autonomy, particularly in commercial contracts, but excludes certain contracts like those involving immovable property and consumer contracts. Ethiopian courts have not fully developed a clear approach to party autonomy in international commercial contracts. The Hague Principles are not yet integrated but may influence future revisions of Ethiopian law. According to the legislation currently in force in Ethiopia, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place with which the contract is significantly connected."

United Kingdom,GBR,"The United Kingdom's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is shaped by its historical ties with the European Union and its own common law traditions. During its EU membership, the UK adhered to the 1980 Rome Convention and later the Rome I Regulation, which governs contracts entered into from 17 December 2009. Despite leaving the EU on 31 January 2020, the UK continues to apply the Rome I Regulation to contracts concluded before the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. For contracts concluded after this date, the UK has retained the Rome I Regulation as part of its domestic law, subject to future legislative and judicial developments. The UK courts interpret the Rome I Regulation autonomously, not constrained by national rules, and may consider non-binding CJEU decisions post-Brexit. The common law in the UK emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, with the courts determining the law based on the parties' intentions or the closest connection if no choice is made. According to the legislation currently in force in this country, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law with which it has the closest and most real connection."
Georgia,GEO,"The private international law (PIL) framework in the South Caucasus, encompassing Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, is primarily statutory, with each country having its own legislation influenced by the 1994 CIS Model Civil Code. These statutes are complemented by CIS treaties like the Kishinev and Minsk Conventions, which provide choice-of-law provisions. Armenia also adheres to the Kiev Convention. Case law, particularly in Armenia, plays a significant role in interpreting these statutes, with Armenian courts recognizing the stare decisis principle. Party autonomy is a central tenet, allowing parties to choose applicable laws, although non-state laws are generally excluded unless incorporated by reference. In the absence of a choice, Armenian and Azerbaijani laws default to the law of the party providing the characteristic performance, while Georgian law applies the law of the country most closely related to the contract. According to the legislation currently in force in these countries, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the party providing the characteristic performance or the country most closely related to the contract."
Guernsey,GGY,
Ghana,GHA,"In the common law African countries of the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia, the choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is primarily shaped by judicial decisions rather than legislation. The common law tradition dominates, with English court jurisprudence serving as a significant source of persuasive authority due to the underdeveloped nature of private international law (PIL) regimes in these countries.

Guatemala,GTM,"Guatemala's private international law (PIL) framework for international commercial contracts is primarily derived from international treaties, such as the Bustamante Code and the Inter-American Convention on General Rules of Private International Law, alongside national laws like the Law of the Judicial Branch and the Arbitration Law. The regime acknowledges party autonomy, allowing parties to select the applicable law for their contracts, although this choice can be influenced by the dispute resolution mechanism chosen, whether litigation or arbitration. Guatemalan courts have historically struggled with distinguishing between jurisdictional and choice-of-law issues, as evidenced by cases involving offshore banks. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts are not currently recognized as persuasive authority in Guatemala, but they could potentially guide future legislative updates. The current legal framework does not require a connection between the chosen law and the contract or parties, and non-state laws can be chosen in arbitration. According to the legislation currently in force in Guatemala, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place of performance."

The principles are primarily derived from common law, with significant influence from English court decisions, and to a lesser extent, statutory provisions. Party autonomy is generally respected, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, unless the choice is made in bad faith or contravenes public policy. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts align closely with Hong Kong's approach, and while not binding, they can inform judicial decisions. Hong Kong law does not explicitly exclude renvoi, and the application of foreign law is contingent on the parties' agreement. In the absence of a choice, the law of the place most closely connected to the contract typically governs. According to the legislation currently in force in Hong Kong, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the jurisdiction with the closest connection to the agreement."

Indonesia,IDN,"Indonesia's private international law (PIL) framework is largely based on the remnants of Dutch colonial legislation, specifically the Algemene Bepalingen (AB), which continues to serve as the foundation for determining applicable law in the absence of comprehensive codification. The AB outlines key principles such as lex patriae for personal status, lex situs for property rights, and lex loci actus for legal acts, including contracts. Despite the lack of a systematic statutory framework, party autonomy is recognized, allowing parties to choose the governing law for their contracts, although this is not explicitly codified. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts (2015) are expected to influence future codification efforts, although their acceptance by Indonesian courts remains uncertain due to the courts' insular nature and inconsistent application of choice-of-law principles. The Indonesian government is working towards a comprehensive PIL statute, with the Draft PIL Act incorporating elements of the Hague Principles.

Party autonomy is a key principle, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts, although the acceptance of non-state laws like lex mercatoria remains uncertain. Indian law permits both express and tacit choices of law, with the latter requiring clear inference of the parties' intentions. The principle of severability is acknowledged, particularly in arbitration contexts, and renvoi is generally excluded.

Iran is not a member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and has not adopted the Hague Conventions or the CISG. The development of PIL in Iran is limited due to historical factors, political concerns, and economic sanctions, which have hindered international commerce. The Iranian Civil Code, particularly Article 968, dictates that in the absence of a choice, contracts are governed by the law of the place where the contract is concluded (lex loci contractus). Party autonomy is recognized but is limited to contracts between foreigners, allowing them to choose any law. The LICA, influenced by the UNCITRAL Model Law, supports party autonomy in arbitration, allowing parties to choose the applicable law.

The Knesset has not adopted conflict rules for international commercial contracts, except for those related to the international sale of goods. Israel is a member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and has ratified several Hague Conventions, including the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). Israeli courts rely on case law and general legal principles, often drawing from comparative law and doctrinal writings, to resolve PIL issues.

Japan,JPN,"Japan's private international law (PIL) framework is rooted in the civil law system, with influences from Western legal systems since the late 19th century. The Japanese Act on General Rules for Application of Laws (AGRAL), enacted in 2006, governs choice-of-law issues in international commercial contracts. Party autonomy is a central principle, allowing parties to select the applicable law for their contracts, as established in Article 7 AGRAL. In the absence of a choice, the law most closely connected to the contract applies, typically presumed to be the habitual residence of the party performing the characteristic obligation (Article 8 AGRAL). The AGRAL does not explicitly recognize non-state laws, but recent academic discussions suggest a growing openness to their inclusion. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts are not directly applicable but can guide interpretation and fill gaps in the AGRAL.

South Korea,KOR,"South Korea's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is primarily governed by the Private International Law Act of Korea (KPILA) and the Arbitration Act of Korea (KAA). The KPILA, a comprehensive statute, outlines rules for applicable law and international jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters, emphasizing party autonomy. It allows parties to choose the applicable law, including a neutral law with no connection to the parties or transaction. In the absence of a choice, the contract is governed by the law most closely connected to it, with a rebuttable presumption based on characteristic performance. The KPILA also includes specific provisions for consumer and employment contracts to protect weaker parties. While the KPILA does not explicitly allow for non-state laws to govern contracts, it permits their incorporation by reference. The KAA, modeled on the UNCITRAL Model Law, provides simpler choice-of-law rules for arbitration, allowing parties to designate the applicable law or rules of law. According to the legislation currently in force in South Korea, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the country most closely connected to it."
Kuwait,KWT,"Kuwait's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is governed by Law No. 5/1961, which outlines conflict of laws rules applicable in both national courts and arbitral tribunals.

In the absence of a choice, Article 59(1) dictates that the law of the state where both parties are domiciled applies, or, if no common domicile exists, the law of the state where the contract was concluded. The Kuwaiti legal system is influenced by Egyptian law and recognizes the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts as a model for interpretation and development. The framework also addresses specific contract types, such as international sales and employment contracts, with distinct rules. Kuwait's adherence to international conventions, like the New York Convention, further integrates its legal system into the global arbitration framework.

Lao People's Democratic Republic,LAO,
Lebanon,LBN,"In Lebanon, the private international law (PIL) framework for international commercial contracts is not codified, leaving courts to develop conflict of law rules. The Lebanese Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) provides some statutory rules relevant to international jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions, and international arbitration. In the absence of statutory choice-of-law rules, Lebanese judges rely on general principles, custom, and equity, as directed by Article 4 CCP. Judicial decisions, particularly from the Cassation Court, play a significant role in shaping the legal landscape, although they do not serve as binding precedents. International conventions take precedence over domestic rules, but Lebanon is not a party to the Hague conventions on conflict of laws. Party autonomy is recognized, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, though this is not explicitly codified. Courts may infer a tacit choice of law from contract circumstances. In the absence of a choice, Lebanese courts determine the applicable law by localizing the contract through various connecting factors.

The Liechtenstein PILA emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for international commercial contracts without needing a specific connection to the transaction. In the absence of a choice, the law of the country where the party providing the characteristic performance is established governs the contract. Liechtenstein's legal system also incorporates several autochthonous rules, particularly concerning legal entities, and follows the theory of incorporation for determining the applicable law for companies. Arbitration matters are governed by the Liechtenstein Civil Procedure Code, which aligns with Austrian arbitration reforms. Although not a member of the Hague Conference, Liechtenstein recognizes several Hague Conventions and bilateral treaties.

Party autonomy is a key principle, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for international commercial contracts, as stipulated in Articles 40 and 41 of the Macau Civil Code. However, the chosen law must have a substantial connection to the contract. The Macau legal system does not clearly accept non-state laws, and court decisions, while not binding, can be persuasive. Macau's PIL framework includes general and specific conflict rules, with a focus on neutrality and bilateralism. The ""closest connection"" test is used to determine the applicable law in the absence of a choice, though its application lacks detailed guidance. According to the legislation currently in force in Macau, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the jurisdiction with the closest connection to the contract."
Morocco,MAR,"Morocco's private international law (PIL) framework for international commercial contracts is shaped by both national and international sources.

This choice is supported by Moroccan case law and scholarly writings, which play significant roles in interpreting and developing PIL rules. International treaties also influence Moroccan PIL, with the Constitution affirming the primacy of international conventions over domestic law. Morocco's membership in the Hague Conference since 1993 and its adherence to several Hague Conventions further integrate international norms into its legal system. Moroccan courts recognize international customs and may refer to the Hague Principles for unresolved issues. In the absence of a choice by the parties, Article 13(2) of the DCC dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the parties' common domicile, or in its absence, their common nationality, or the law of the place of contract conclusion."

In the absence of a choice, Article 9 dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the state with the closest ties, considering both objective and subjective elements and international commercial law principles. The Convention also allows for the application of international commercial customs and practices to ensure justice and equity. Article 11 mandates the application of the forum's mandatory provisions and permits the discretionary application of another state's mandatory provisions closely connected to the contract. The Federal Civil Code complements this by stipulating that, without a valid choice, the contract is governed by the law of the place of performance.

However, this autonomy is not absolute; the chosen law must have a relevant connection to the contract or reflect a serious interest of the parties (Article 41(2) CC). The legal systems of Angola and Mozambique continue to rely heavily on Portuguese judgments and doctrine due to the limited development of their own jurisprudence. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts (2015) are not explicitly recognized but could aid in interpreting the outdated conflict-of-law rules. Both countries' arbitration acts support party autonomy, though the acceptance of non-state laws like lex mercatoria remains uncertain.

However, Mauritius lacks a comprehensive private international law (PIL) regime, with no explicit PIL provisions in the Code Civil Mauricien or other legislative codifications. Instead, Mauritian PIL has developed through case law, often relying on French jurisprudence. The Mauritian courts have traditionally applied French conflict of law rules, although there is a shift towards English choice of law rules. The Mauritian Law Reform Commission (MLRC) is working on incorporating PIL rules into the Code Civil Mauricien, drawing inspiration from the Code Civil du Québec.

It supersedes the 1980 Rome Convention and applies to contracts concluded after December 17, 2009. The Regulation emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts. However, it excludes certain issues like arbitration agreements, insolvency proceedings, and the capacity of natural persons. The Regulation aligns with the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts, and the European Court of Justice (CJEU) ensures its uniform interpretation across the EU. In the absence of a choice of law by the parties, the Rome I Regulation dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the country where the party required to effect the characteristic performance of the contract has their habitual residence."
Norway,NOR,"Norway's private international law (PIL) framework is evolving, with significant influence from EU conflict rules despite Norway not being an EU member. Historically, Norwegian courts used a discretionary approach, applying the principle of the closest connection to determine applicable law. However, recent developments have shifted towards a more predictable method, aligning with EU regulations like Rome I and Rome II. Although Norway is not bound by these EU regulations, they are influential, and a proposal for a statute on the law applicable to obligations, largely based on these regulations, is under consideration. Norwegian PIL remains largely uncodified, with specific conflict rules derived from international conventions and European directives, such as the 1964 Act on the Law Applicable to the International Sale of Goods. Party autonomy is a recognized principle, but the role of soft law, like the Hague Principles, is limited. According to the legislation currently in force in Norway, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the country with which it has the closest connection, often interpreted through EU conflict rules."

New Zealand,NZL,"New Zealand's private international law framework for international commercial contracts is primarily governed by common law principles inherited from English law. The central tenet is party autonomy, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts. In the absence of such a choice, the law with the closest and most real connection to the contract is applied. New Zealand courts have limited case law on choice of law rules due to the country's size and isolation, but the increasing importance of international trade has highlighted the need for clear rules. While there are no current plans for legislative reform, the judiciary continues to interpret and develop these rules, often looking to English common law for guidance. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts (2015) may serve as persuasive authority if they align with New Zealand's legal principles. According to the legislation currently in force in New Zealand, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place with the closest and most real connection to the contract."

Panama,PAN,"Panama's private international law (PIL) framework is rooted in its Civil Code, which draws heavily from the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 and the Civil Code of Andrés Bello. The Panamanian legal system, influenced by both civil and common law traditions, emphasizes statutes as the primary source of law, with judicial decisions serving as interpretative guides rather than binding precedents. The 2015 Code of Private International Law (PIL Code) consolidates Panama's PIL rules, including those on jurisdiction and choice of law for international contracts. Party autonomy is a central principle, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, though this choice is subject to limitations such as public policy and fraud. The PIL Code also recognizes the use of international principles, like the Hague Principles, to interpret and fill gaps in the law. In the absence of a choice, the PIL Code dictates that the law of the place of performance governs the contract, or alternatively, the law with the closest connection, and if neither can be determined, the lex fori applies."
Pitcairn,PCN,
Peru,PER,"Peru's private international law framework is primarily governed by Book X of the Peruvian Civil Code, established in 1984, which allows parties to freely choose the governing law for their contracts. This framework provides a structured conflict of laws system addressing international judicial assistance, court competence, choice of law, and recognition of foreign decisions. Book X is divided into four titles, covering general PIL principles, jurisdictional matters, applicable law for various legal areas, and recognition of foreign judgments. Despite Peru's historical engagement with international treaties on PIL, recent legislative changes have been minimal, with the notable exception of a new arbitration act. The Peruvian system does not distinguish between commercial and non-commercial contracts and lacks a definition for international contracts. Courts may use international principles, such as the Hague Principles, to interpret and supplement the Civil Code. According to the legislation currently in force in Peru, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the place where the contract is to be performed."

Paraguay,PRY,"Paraguay's legal framework for international commercial contracts is influenced by its 1992 Constitution, which prioritizes ratified treaties over national laws. The Civil and Commercial Code of 1987 provides the basic conflict-of-law rules, supplemented by various special laws. Paraguay has ratified several international conventions, including the Montevideo Treaties and the Inter-American Convention on General Rules of Private International Law. The country is a member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law and has adopted the Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts. The Paraguayan Law 5393, enacted in 2015, is heavily influenced by these principles and the Mexico Convention of 1994, allowing for party autonomy in choosing applicable law, including non-State laws like the UNIDROIT Principles. The law excludes consumer and employment contracts and emphasizes the closest connection principle in the absence of a choice. According to the legislation currently in force in Paraguay, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the state with which it has the closest connection."
Palestine,PSE,"In Palestine, the choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is influenced by historical legal systems, including the Ottoman, British Mandate, and Jordanian laws, with the Mejella still applicable in the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority's 2003 draft civil law (PDCL), enacted in Gaza as the GCL in 2012, includes conflict of laws rules similar to those in Egypt and Jordan, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for international commercial contracts. The 2000 Palestinian Arbitration Law (PAL) also supports party autonomy. Palestine acceded to the CISG, which takes precedence over national law for international sales of goods. The Hague Principles on Choice of Law in International Commercial Contracts are not yet enacted but could influence future revisions. In the absence of a choice, Article 25(1) of the PDCL/GCL dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the state where both parties are domiciled, or if domiciled in different states, by the law of the state where the contract is concluded."
French Polynesia,PYF,
Qatar,QAT,"In Qatar, the choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is governed by the Qatar Civil Code (Federal Law No 22 of 2004), specifically Articles 10-38, which are largely modeled after the Egyptian Civil Code of 1949. This framework allows parties to an international contract to select the governing law, provided it does not contravene Qatari public order or morals (Article 38). The principle of party autonomy is central, but it does not extend to issues of capacity and form, and is limited in cases involving immovable property and employment contracts. The Qatari courts require foreign law to be proven as fact, which can be challenging, especially with uncodified laws. In the absence of a choice, Article 27 of the Qatar Civil Code dictates that the contract is governed by the law of the common domicile of the parties, or if domiciles differ, by the law of the state where the contract was concluded."

Russia,RUS,"Russia's choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is governed by a combination of domestic legislation and international treaties. Key sources include the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Code of Arbitrazh Procedure, and the Federal Law on Fundamentals of State Regulation of International Trade. International treaties to which Russia is a signatory take precedence over domestic law in case of conflict. Russian courts may also consider international instruments if incorporated into agreements between parties. While case law is not a formal source of law, resolutions from the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court's Plenum provide interpretive guidance. Party autonomy is a fundamental principle, allowing parties to choose the applicable law, though this choice is subject to certain restrictions, such as mandatory rules and public policy considerations. In the absence of a choice, the applicable law is determined by the characteristic performance test, which typically points to the law of the state where the party performing the contract's main obligation is located. According to the legislation currently in force in Russia, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the state of the party performing the characteristic obligation.

For the Russian jurisdiction, it is particularly important to note that the ‘Arbitrazh’ courts, judgments, or laws, are not to be confused with ‘arbitration’. Arbitrazh, in the Russian context, refers to ‘commercial’.  "

Singapore,SGP,"Singapore's private international law framework is primarily based on common law, supplemented by statutes. The common law was formally integrated into Singapore's legal system in 1826, with modifications for local circumstances. Key statutes include the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and the Foreign Limitation Periods Act, which address jurisdiction and choice of law issues. Singapore adopts a dualist approach to international law, requiring treaties to be enacted as local legislation to have legal effect. Notable international instruments adopted include the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements and the 1980 United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. Party autonomy is a fundamental principle, allowing parties to choose the applicable law for their contracts, with limitations for public policy and mandatory rules. In the absence of a choice, the law with the closest and most real connection to the contract is applied.

Albania, distinct in its legal evolution, adopted a new PIL Act in 2011. These countries generally recognize party autonomy in international contracts, aligning with the Rome Convention and EU regulations, although the Hague Principles on Choice of Law are not explicitly integrated. Kosovo, due to its disputed statehood, faces unique challenges in international treaty participation. The region's legal systems are gradually modernizing, with ongoing reforms in Serbia, North Macedonia, and Kosovo aiming for EU harmonization.

The CPIL emphasizes party autonomy, allowing parties to select the applicable law for their contracts, as outlined in Article 62. This principle is also supported by the Tunisian Arbitration Code (TAC) and specific statutes like the Code of Maritime Commerce. Tunisia has not signed any international conventions specifically on choice of law for contracts, but it is a party to several sector-specific treaties and conventions related to international arbitration, such as the 1958 New York Convention. Tunisian courts may refer to foreign laws and international conventions not ratified by Tunisia if deemed persuasive. The CPIL is currently under review for potential reform to address challenges in its application. According to the legislation currently in force in Tunisia, if no choice is made, the contract is governed by the law of the domicile of the party providing the characteristic performance."
Türkiye,TUR,"Turkey's private international law (PIL) framework is primarily governed by Law No. 5718 on Private International Law and Procedural Law (PILA), effective since 2007.

The Turkish Commercial Code also includes conflict of laws rules for specific commercial instruments and maritime disputes. Turkey is a party to various international conventions and bilateral agreements in this field. According to Article 1(2) of PILA, international treaties ratified by Turkey take precedence over national PIL rules. The PILA allows for party autonomy in choosing the applicable law for contracts, with Article 24 providing a general rule for contracts not covered by specific provisions. In the absence of a choice, Article 24(4) presumes that the contract is governed by the law of the country most closely connected to it, typically where the party required to effect the characteristic performance has their place of business.

In the absence of an express choice, the law most closely connected to the juridical act applies, with a presumption favoring the law of the domicile of the party obligated under the characteristic obligation. If the contract involves immovable property, the law of the property's location is presumed to apply. Taiwan's approach is largely domestic, as it is not a member of many international organizations like the Hague Conference.

Party autonomy is not broadly recognized; parties can only choose the applicable law if the place of performance is outside Uruguay and the foreign jurisdiction allows such autonomy. The Draft General Act on Private International Law, currently under consideration, proposes to allow party autonomy more broadly, aligning with international trends. However, until this draft is enacted, the current system remains in place.

United States of America,USA,"The United States' choice-of-law framework for international commercial contracts is characterized by a strong tradition of party autonomy, allowing parties to select the governing law for their contracts. This principle was first recognized in the 19th century and has since been reinforced by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. The UCC, particularly Section 1-301, applies to contracts within its scope, while the Restatement (Second) is followed by most states for contracts outside the UCC's purview. The UCC and Restatement (Second) both require a substantial relationship or reasonable basis for the chosen law, although some states, like Louisiana and Oregon, have codifications that do not impose such requirements. The U.S. is a party to the CISG, with certain reservations, and recognizes the Hague Principles as a potential interpretative tool. In the absence of a choice, the applicable law is determined by the state with the most significant relationship to the transaction and parties, as per the Restatement (Second).
