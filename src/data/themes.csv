Party autonomy,"Party autonomy refers to the power of the parties to a contract to choose a neutral law or the law they consider most appropriate for their specific contract. It enhances certainty and predictability within the parties’ primary contractual arrangement and recognizes that parties to a contract may be in the best position to determine which set of legal principles is most suitable for their transaction. Many States have reached this conclusion and, as a result, giving effect to party autonomy is the predominant view today. However, there are considerable differences regarding the scope of this concept (e.g. with respect to consumer or employment contracts). "
Tacit choice,"A “tacit choice of law” is a not explicitly stated choice of law, which can be inferred from contractual provisions or the circumstances surrounding the parties’ agreements. While a tacit choice stems from the principle of party autonomy, it requires clear evidence from the contract or its circumstances, indicating that the parties intended a specific legal system to govern their contract."
Partial choice,Partial choice is the prerogative of the parties to indicate that the chosen law does not apply to the entirety of the contract.
Absence of choice,"Absence of choice means that the parties have no agreement on choice of law (e.g., no choice of law clause inserted in their contract), or when a choice of law clause is invalid. In the absence of contractual choice, the adjudicator (judge or arbitrator) must determine the law applicable to the transaction/case."
Arbitration,"Arbitration is a mechanism whereby the settlement of a dispute between two or more parties is entrusted to one or more persons (the arbitrator(s)). The arbitrators derive their powers from a private agreement (the arbitration agreement) and not primarily from the authority of a State. They proceed and decide the case on the basis of the arbitration agreement by rendering a final and binding arbitral award. The parties may specify, either in the arbitration agreement itself (ad hoc arbitration) or indirectly by choosing a set of arbitration rules (institutional arbitration), the method of appointing the arbitrators, the seat (or place) of the arbitration, and also the procedure to be followed while conducting the arbitral process. The guiding principle in arbitration is party autonomy."
Freedom of Choice,Freedom of choice (also known as the 'principle of freedom of choice'). This term refers to the ability of parties involved in an international transaction to determine themselves the legal system governing their legal relationship. This principle is often referred to as 'party autonomy'.
Rules of Law,"Rules of law (also known as 'non-government rules' or 'non-state law'). This term refers to legal norms that are not created by a national government or state. Examples include religious law, tribal law and customary practices recognised and applied by courts or arbitration tribunals."
Dépeçage,"Dépeçage is a private international law concept that refers to the process of applying different legal systems or laws to different issues within the same legal relationship. Instead of applying a single jurisdiction’s laws to all aspects of a case, dépeçage allows dissecting the case and applying different laws to different parts of it, based on the most relevant connections those parts have to particular legal systems.  Dépeçage enables the resolution of legal issues by engaging in a choice-of-law analysis on an issue-by-issue basis, but bears the risk of inconsistencies among the various legal systems applied. "
Public policy,"Public policy, in the context of private international law, typically refers to a nation's core legal principles that protect fundamental values and interests, which can override the application of foreign laws or judgments that contravene these principles."
Mandatory rules,"Overriding mandatory rules can be defined as mandatory rules that are crucial for the countries’ economic, social and political purposes, and their application is required for the disputes within their scope in order to implement the previously mentioned purposes. There are three categories of overriding mandatory rules: overriding mandatory rules pertaining to lex fori; overriding mandatory rules pertaining to lex causae; and finally, overriding mandatory rules of a third country. Overriding mandatory rules take precedent over rules chosen by the parties and therefore supersede them."
Consumer contracts,"A contract for the sale of goods or services, or the supply of digital content, involving vulnerable parties that do not possess the same negotiation power. Also known as ""standard contracts"" or ""standard clauses"". These clauses (or sale agreements) in a contract to the consumer provide a disproportionate advantage to the seller. It only concerns selling to consumers who buy outside their professional sphere. "
Employment contracts,A contract between an employer and an employee that outlines the terms and conditions of their working relationship. The employee is a vulnerable party that lacks the same level of negotiation power.
