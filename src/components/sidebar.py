 1. Search for a case in the [Choice of Law Dataverse](https://cold.global).
 2. Upload the PDF file for text extraction or copy and paste the decision content.
 3. Click to detect the jurisdiction.
 4. Confirm the jurisdiction and its legal system. The tool adapts to different contexts (Civil Law or Common Law).
 5. The extraction process begins automatically (please note that after the first step, it may take a couple of minutes for the second step to be completed). You can monitor active processing through the running indicators at the top of the page.
 6. The system processes the decision through a structured workflow. A complete summary is generated within five minutes. Please note that outputs are structured in English regardless of the input language, except for Choice of Law Sections.
 7. Once the results are displayed, you can review the content and the system's confidence level as to the quality of the analysis.
 8. Each category is editable. You can modify the case citation if necessary and select different theme tags within our research scope. If no indicated theme applies to the decision, use the tag ‚ÄúNA‚Äù.
 9. The system tends to overextract ‚ÄúChoice of Law Section‚Äù. You can delete parts that are not relevant for the analysis.
 10. If you notice any mistakes in the generated text for Relevant Facts, Sources, Choice of Law Issue, Court‚Äôs Position, and Abstract, please remove them before submitting a final analysis.
 11. You can provide your contact information to become a registered Case Analyzer user and gain access to additional features using your login credentials.
 12. Click to submit your (revised) analysis. You can then print or save a copy of the results for your records.

This tool is powered by OpenAI's GPT-5. It serves as a guide to be used alongside the original court decision, which may be in a foreign language. We recommend verifying the information, as the Case Analyzer may occasionally produce errors.
