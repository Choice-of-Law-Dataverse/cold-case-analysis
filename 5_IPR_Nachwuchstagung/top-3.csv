BGE 130 III 620,Consideration of third-country intervention norms under Art. 19 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA); prerequisites and exceptional nature of Art. 19 PILA. Conditions that must be met under Art. 19(1) PILA for a third-country intervention norm to apply (Sections 3.3-3.5). The consideration of such norms must remain exceptional and is particularly not applicable when the PILA itself provides a special regulation. The legal assistance provided in Art. 166 et seq. PILA for the recognition of a foreign bankruptcy decree constitutes such a special regulation (Section 3.5.1).,"A.B., residing in California, USA, filed a lawsuit against D. SA, a company based in Geneva with a branch in Zurich, seeking CHF 703,310 plus interest from account X, which she opened at the defendant's Zurich branch on April 5, 1993. Both A.B. and her husband, A.C., were economically entitled to the account, with A.C. having authority to operate it. On February 15, 1994, A.B. and A.C. entered into a Post Nuptial Agreement, assigning all assets outside the USA to A.B. and those within the USA to A.C. A.C. declared bankruptcy in California on June 14, 1996, and a trustee was appointed. The trustee requested information from D. SA regarding A.C.'s accounts, citing U.S. Bankruptcy Code provisions. D. SA refused, citing Swiss banking secrecy laws. A.B. sued in the Zurich Commercial Court, which dismissed the claim on October 24, 2003, citing Art. 19 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA), which allows consideration of foreign mandatory rules under specific conditions. The court found that the contract should be adjusted to prevent double payment and potential criminal liability for D. SA, deferring the payment obligation while maintaining interest accrual. A.B. appealed, seeking to overturn the decision, while D. SA filed a cross-appeal for a definitive dismissal. The Swiss Federal Court found that the lower court misapplied Art. 19 PILA, as Swiss law already provides mechanisms for international cooperation in bankruptcy cases, and remanded the case for further proceedings.","Art. 19 PILA, Art. 166 ff. PILA",Mandatory rules,Should the court apply the overriding mandatory rules of a third country under Article 19 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (IPRG) when there is a significant connection to the third country's legal system and the interests involved are deemed worthy of protection under Swiss legal principles?,"In addressing the choice of law issue under Article 19 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (IPRG), the court's position is that the application of overriding mandatory rules from a third country is permissible only under specific conditions. These conditions include: (1) the third country's rule must be intended to apply internationally and mandatorily; (2) there must be a significant connection between the facts of the case and the legal system of the third country; and (3) the interests involved must be deemed worthy of protection and clearly predominant according to Swiss legal principles. Additionally, the consideration of such third-country norms should be an exception rather than the rule and is not applicable if the IPRG itself provides a special regulation for the matter at hand. The court emphasizes that the purpose and consequences of applying the third-country norm must align with a decision that is appropriate under Swiss legal views. In this case, the court found that the Swiss legal framework already provided mechanisms to address the interests protected by the third-country norm, thus negating the need to apply the foreign mandatory rule."
BGE 132 III 285,"Article 116 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA); admissibility of choice of law. Regulations of private law associations cannot be the subject of a choice of law under Article 116 PILA. They can only become part of the contract within the framework of a substantive law reference, taking into account the mandatory provisions of the applicable substantive law (E. 1). The provision that claims must be brought before a court within a certain period violates Article 129 of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) and is therefore irrelevant (E. 2).","The case involves X. AG, a company based in St. Gallen, Switzerland (plaintiff), and Y., a Greek corporation (defendant). On August 16, 1999, X. AG, represented by a FIFA agent, entered into a contract with Y. for the transfer of a player. The agreement stipulated payments to X. AG of USD 15,000 by September 30, 1999, another USD 15,000 by December 30, 1999, contingent on the extension of the player's contract until June 30, 2000, and further payments of USD 30,000 by December 30, 2000, and USD 30,000 by December 30, 2001, if the contract was extended for two more years. On February 5, 2003, X. AG filed a lawsuit at the Commercial Court of the Canton of St. Gallen, claiming USD 15,000 with 5% interest from September 30, 1999, USD 15,000 with 5% interest from December 30, 1999, and USD 30,000 with 5% interest from December 30, 2000. The defendant did not participate in the proceedings. The Commercial Court dismissed the claim, leading X. AG to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court, seeking to overturn the decision. The contract included a choice of law clause stating it was governed by FIFA rules and Swiss law. The lower court interpreted this as a cumulative choice of law, giving precedence to FIFA rules as lex specialis over Swiss law. The court applied a FIFA regulation requiring claims to be filed within two years, dismissing the case as time-barred. X. AG argued that the FIFA regulation could not be a subject of choice of law under Art. 116 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA). The Federal Supreme Court found that private association rules, like FIFA's, do not qualify as legal norms under Art. 116 PILA and can only be incorporated into contracts as material law references, subordinate to mandatory national law. The court ruled that the lower court erred in treating the FIFA rules as a choice of law and remanded the case for reconsideration based on Swiss law, which prohibits shortening the statutory limitation period under Art. 129 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.","Art. 116 PILA, Art. 129 CO",Non-State law (rules of law),"Can parties choose non-state rules, such as those established by private organizations, as the governing law for their contract under Article 116 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (IPRG)?","The court's position on the choice of law issue under Article 116 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (IPRG) is that parties cannot choose non-state rules, such as those established by private organizations, as the governing law for their contract. The court determined that regulations set by private associations do not qualify as legal norms under Article 116 IPRG. Instead, these rules can only be incorporated into a contract through a substantive reference, meaning they can be included as contractual terms but are subordinate to mandatory provisions of the applicable national law. Therefore, such non-state rules cannot replace the legal framework provided by a state legal system in the context of a choice of law under Article 116 IPRG."
BGE 133 III 90,"Change of connecting factors in long-term contractual relationships; applicable law; change of statute (Art. 117 PILA). Conditions under which a change in a connecting factor in long-term contractual relationships leads to a change of statute (E. 2). If a contractual relationship is functionally oriented towards the provider of the characteristic performance delivering the agreed performance unchanged, regardless of their location, a change of residence during an ongoing contractual relationship does not result in a change of statute (E. 3).","A.B. and B.B., residents of Greece, filed a lawsuit on December 19, 2003, in the District Court of Zurich against X., seeking an account of X.'s activities as their deceased father's agent, the release of various documents, and 50% of the shares in a company based in Vaduz, which their father co-founded. The shares were held in a trust arrangement involving X. as the attorney for both business partners. X. contested the existence of a contractual relationship and the jurisdiction of the court. The District Court, relying on the plaintiffs' claim of a contractual relationship, determined its jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention, noting that X. resided in Spain and not Switzerland. The court found jurisdiction at the place of performance under Art. 5(1) of the Lugano Convention, applying Swiss law per Art. 117 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA), as X. was domiciled in Zurich at the contract's conclusion, and his subsequent relocation did not result in a change of applicable law. The District Court rejected X.'s objection to jurisdiction on January 25, 2005, a decision upheld by the Zurich High Court on June 1, 2006. X. appealed to the Federal Court, which dismissed the appeal, affirming that the contract's closest connection remained with Swiss law, as the contract was functionally oriented towards the unchanged performance of the agreed service, irrespective of X.'s relocation.",Art. 117 PILA,Connecting factors,Does a change in the residence of the party providing the characteristic performance in a long-term contractual relationship necessitate a change in the applicable law under Article 117 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA)?,"In addressing the choice of law issue under Article 117 of the Swiss Private International Law Act (PILA), the court held that a change in the residence of the party providing the characteristic performance in a long-term contractual relationship does not automatically necessitate a change in the applicable law. The court emphasized that the presumptions established in Article 117 PILA aim to ensure legal certainty and predictability. Allowing a party to unilaterally influence the applicable law through actions such as changing residence would undermine these objectives and contradict the spirit of contract law, which does not permit one party to unilaterally alter the contract's content.
The court further noted that for a change in the applicable law to be justified, there must be a significant shift in the contract's connection to a new legal system, which was not evident in this case. The contract was functionally oriented towards the consistent performance of the agreed-upon duties, regardless of the provider's location. Therefore, the closest connection remained with the legal system that governed the contract at the time of its conclusion. The court concluded that the change in residence did not result in a shift of the contractual relationship's center of gravity, and thus, the original applicable law continued to govern the contract."
